This is a cultural question: \u00a0Expensive campaigns create a political environment that alienates women with families or other job prospects.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"Look, I\u2019ve had $100 million spent mischaracterizing who I am,\" she said. \u201cWomen see that and they say, 'I could never take that.

Nancy Pelosi, surrounded by male members of Congress (Reuters)Women make up less than 20 percent of Congress. Out of 100 senators, 20 are female; out of 435 representatives, there are 78 women. According to the World Economic Forum, that puts the United States at 60th in the world for political equality between the sexes, right behind countries like Sri Lanka, Serbia, and Senegal. A series from The Atlantic and The Shriver Report Read More At The Atlantic's Shriver Report summit on women and poverty on Wednesday, former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered her thoughts on why this gap persists. \u201cIf you reduce the role of money in politics and increase the level of civility in debate, more women will run for office,\u201d she said. To Pelosi, this isn't a question of ability; women are quite capable of raising the money they need to run for office, she said. This is a cultural question: Expensive campaigns create a political environment that alienates women with families or other job prospects. \"Look, I\u2019ve had $100 million spent mischaracterizing who I am,\" she said. \u201cWomen see that and they say, 'I could never take that. I would never subject my family to any mischaracterizations about me.'\" Because of this, women who are leaders in other fields shy away from diving into the all-out battle of running for office.

Two pro-Israel groups, Hillel International and the Israel on Campus Coalition, issued a statement criticizing the group for accepting a lineup with only scholars who were broadly supportive of the B.D.S. movement. They also organized a counterpanel at a nearby hotel featuring prominent M.L.A. members who are opposed to boycotts.Some of them defended the group\u2019s right to approve such a gathering, saying that many scholarly panels are devoted to exploring one point of view. But at the panel, and in leaflets distributed during the meeting, they questioned the documentary evidence provided by supporters of the travel resolution, as well as its singular focus on Israel.\u201cI would strongly support a resolution looking into refusal of visas for all countries,\u201d Cary Nelson, a former president of the American Association of University Professors, said during the debate on Saturday. He added: \u201cThis is a biased resolution.\u201dFull passage is by no means assured. Some of the scholars chatting in the halls between panels on topics like \u201cMiddle English Keywords\u201d or \u201cAfrican American Voices From the Civil War\u201d said they were unconcerned about the measure, or even unaware of it.Others expressed dismay at what they saw as a conversation that slid too quickly on both sides from issues of academic freedom to partisan claims.\u201cIt arrived partisan, and it never had a chance to become nonpartisan,\u201d said Derrick Miller, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington and a member of the delegate assembly. \u201cI hear echoes of cable news debates rather than something academic.\u201dDiscussion grew even more heated at the assembly. Mr. Nelson suggested that removing the word \u201carbitrary\u201d from the resolution\u2019s description of Israel\u2019s denials of entry had made the resolution meaningless, while supporters criticized a last-minute effort to introduce a substitute resolution applying to all governments as \u201cprocedural obstruction.\u201dAfter the vote, Mr. Nelson and other opponents predicted it would damage the association and its broader mission of promoting the beleaguered humanities. But Bruce Robbins, a professor at Columbia and one of the resolution\u2019s sponsors, defended the measure. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a dangerous politicization to defend the rights of academics,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did.\u201d Correction: January 13, 2014 An earlier version of article misstated the name of one pro-Israel group that criticized the Modern Language Association resolution. It is the Israel on Campus Coalition, not the Israel Campus Coalition.

The protesters' drive to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office and eliminate the influence of her brother, billionaire former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, has been marked by a series of escalating protests, each more ambitious than the last. Monday's rally was touted as a bid to shut down Bangkok for a week or more and reboot Thailand's democracy, this time without the Shinawatra clan in command.

Perched in a bunker built from rubber tires and fortified with sharpened bamboo stakes near the government's main headquarters, Nitithorn Lamlua on Monday laid out some of the options the protesters could take if Ms. Yingluck refuses to quit.

And many of my fellow Americans, some of whom are here, feel that same sense of loss.</p><p>I say to Prime Minister Sharon\u2019s beloved and devoted sons, Omri and Gilad, and the entire family, particularly the sons who spent so much time caring for their father in the last few years, it\u2019s a great honor you\u2019ve afforded me on behalf of my country to bring the sympathies of the President of the United States and the American people on this occasion.</p><p>To you, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government of Israel, to President Peres, and to the grieving men and women of the nation of Israel, but most particularly to his beloved IDF, his fellow warriors, I fear an attempt to capture him and what he stood for is beyond my capabilities. I knew him for over 30 years. He was not only a powerful man, he was a powerfully built man. And as a young senator, when you first met him you could not help but understand, as they say in the military, this man had a command presence. He filled the room.</p><p>The first time I was invited to his office, he said to me -- and I remember thinking, is he serious? -- he said, Senator, you are mostly welcome. I didn\u2019t know if it was a matter of something being lost in translation or whether he was pulling my leg, as we say in the States, until I spent a few moments with him and realized how incredible his hospitality was. But when the topic of Israel\u2019s security arose, which it always, always, always did in my many meetings over the years with him, you immediately understood how he acquired, as the speakers referenced, the nickname \u201cBulldozer.\u201d He was indomitable.</p><p>Like all historic leaders, Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man about whom, as you\u2019ve already heard from his colleagues, who engendered strong opinions from everyone. But like all historic leaders, all real leaders, he had a North Star that guided him -- a North Star from which he never, in my observation, never deviated. His North Star was the survival of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, wherever they resided.</p><p>In talking about his spiritual attachment to the land of Israel back in an interview in the late \u201890s, he said, and I quote, \u201cBefore and above all else, I am a Jew. My thinking is dominated by the Jews\u2019 future in 30 years, in 300 years, in a thousand years. That\u2019s what preoccupies and interests me first and foremost.\u201d And because he possessed such incredible physical courage -- and I would add political courage -- he never, never, never deviated from that preoccupation and interest, as he referred to it. It was his life\u2019s work that even someone on the shores hundreds of -- thousands of miles from here could see, could smell, could taste, could feel, and when you were in his presence there was never, never any doubt about it.</p><p>The physical courage he had to lead men straight into enemy lines and deep behind them. I remember, as a young senator, that iconic picture of him with that bandage around his head, standing there after a decisive victory, which seemed to symbolize, as Bibi -- as the Prime Minister said, an Israel that had reclaimed its roots of standing up and fighting, needing no help, standing on its own. The political courage it took, whether you agreed with him or not, when he told 10,000 Israelis to leave their homes in Gaza in order, from his perspective, to strengthen Israel. I can\u2019t think of much more controversial; as a student of the Jewish state, I can\u2019t think of a much more difficult and controversial decision that\u2019s been made. But he believed it and he did it.</p><p>The security of his people was always Arik\u2019s unwavering mission, an unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now. We have an expression in the States: never in doubt. Arik was never uncertain from my observation. I don\u2019t know him nearly as well as the Israeli people and his colleagues, but he seemed never in doubt. But there were times when he acted, and those actions earned him controversy and even condemnation. And in certain instances, American leaders -- American Presidents -- had profound differences with him, and they were never shy about stating them nor was he ever shy about stating his position. As I said, from my observation he was a complex man, but to understand him better I think it\u2019s important history will judge he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighborhood.</p><p>Since he passed away, in the days ahead, there will be much written about the Prime Minister. And it\u2019s right for the Israeli people to reflect on all aspects of his life -- the triumphs as well as the mistakes, taking full measure of the man, the arc of his life. For I would argue the arc of his life traced the journey of the State of Israel.</p><p>And through it all, the United States whether we agreed or disagreed with a specific policy has been unflagging in its commitment to the State of Israel. We have never stepped away. We have never diminished our support. We have never failed to make Israel\u2019s case around the world. We have never failed to defend Israel\u2019s legitimacy.</p><p>And no one in any corner of this world has any doubt about where America stands with regard to Israeli security, the independent State of Israel that is the ultimate refuge for Jews wherever they are in the world. And that will never change.</p><p>As President Obama said when he was here in Jerusalem last year, and I quote, \u201cThose who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel\u2019s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above because Israel is not going anywhere. So long as there is a United States of America, you are not alone.\u201d</p><p>For his part, Arik Sharon greatly valued that close friendship between the United States and Israel, and particularly during his years as prime minister, he worked hard to deepen our relationship.</p><p>I find it fascinating, maybe it\u2019s I\u2019m getting older -- I find it fascinating how some look at Israel today and say its success was inevitable. Why didn\u2019t everyone understand this was just inevitable? But at the outset it was anything but inevitable. It was the opposite of inevitable. Israel\u2019s very survival was against all odds. But thankfully Israel was blessed with a founding generation that understood exactly what it took to overcome those odds.

And many of my fellow Americans, some of whom are here, feel that same sense of loss.I say to Prime Minister Sharon\u2019s beloved and devoted sons, Omri and Gilad, and the entire family, particularly the sons who spent so much time caring for their father in the last few years, it\u2019s a great honor you\u2019ve afforded me on behalf of my country to bring the sympathies of the President of the United States and the American people on this occasion.To you, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government of Israel, to President Peres, and to the grieving men and women of the nation of Israel, but most particularly to his beloved IDF, his fellow warriors, I fear an attempt to capture him and what he stood for is beyond my capabilities. I knew him for over 30 years. He was not only a powerful man, he was a powerfully built man. And as a young senator, when you first met him you could not help but understand, as they say in the military, this man had a command presence. He filled the room.The first time I was invited to his office, he said to me -- and I remember thinking, is he serious? -- he said, Senator, you are mostly welcome. I didn\u2019t know if it was a matter of something being lost in translation or whether he was pulling my leg, as we say in the States, until I spent a few moments with him and realized how incredible his hospitality was. But when the topic of Israel\u2019s security arose, which it always, always, always did in my many meetings over the years with him, you immediately understood how he acquired, as the speakers referenced, the nickname \u201cBulldozer.\u201d He was indomitable.Like all historic leaders, Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man about whom, as you\u2019ve already heard from his colleagues, who engendered strong opinions from everyone. But like all historic leaders, all real leaders, he had a North Star that guided him -- a North Star from which he never, in my observation, never deviated. His North Star was the survival of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, wherever they resided.In talking about his spiritual attachment to the land of Israel back in an interview in the late \u201890s, he said, and I quote, \u201cBefore and above all else, I am a Jew. My thinking is dominated by the Jews\u2019 future in 30 years, in 300 years, in a thousand years. That\u2019s what preoccupies and interests me first and foremost.\u201d And because he possessed such incredible physical courage -- and I would add political courage -- he never, never, never deviated from that preoccupation and interest, as he referred to it. It was his life\u2019s work that even someone on the shores hundreds of -- thousands of miles from here could see, could smell, could taste, could feel, and when you were in his presence there was never, never any doubt about it.The physical courage he had to lead men straight into enemy lines and deep behind them. I remember, as a young senator, that iconic picture of him with that bandage around his head, standing there after a decisive victory, which seemed to symbolize, as Bibi -- as the Prime Minister said, an Israel that had reclaimed its roots of standing up and fighting, needing no help, standing on its own. The political courage it took, whether you agreed with him or not, when he told 10,000 Israelis to leave their homes in Gaza in order, from his perspective, to strengthen Israel. I can\u2019t think of much more controversial; as a student of the Jewish state, I can\u2019t think of a much more difficult and controversial decision that\u2019s been made. But he believed it and he did it.The security of his people was always Arik\u2019s unwavering mission, an unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now. We have an expression in the States: never in doubt. Arik was never uncertain from my observation. I don\u2019t know him nearly as well as the Israeli people and his colleagues, but he seemed never in doubt. But there were times when he acted, and those actions earned him controversy and even condemnation. And in certain instances, American leaders -- American Presidents -- had profound differences with him, and they were never shy about stating them nor was he ever shy about stating his position. As I said, from my observation he was a complex man, but to understand him better I think it\u2019s important history will judge he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighborhood.Since he passed away, in the days ahead, there will be much written about the Prime Minister. And it\u2019s right for the Israeli people to reflect on all aspects of his life -- the triumphs as well as the mistakes, taking full measure of the man, the arc of his life. For I would argue the arc of his life traced the journey of the State of Israel.And through it all, the United States whether we agreed or disagreed with a specific policy has been unflagging in its commitment to the State of Israel. We have never stepped away. We have never diminished our support. We have never failed to make Israel\u2019s case around the world. We have never failed to defend Israel\u2019s legitimacy.And no one in any corner of this world has any doubt about where America stands with regard to Israeli security, the independent State of Israel that is the ultimate refuge for Jews wherever they are in the world. And that will never change.As President Obama said when he was here in Jerusalem last year, and I quote, \u201cThose who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel\u2019s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above because Israel is not going anywhere. So long as there is a United States of America, you are not alone.\u201dFor his part, Arik Sharon greatly valued that close friendship between the United States and Israel, and particularly during his years as prime minister, he worked hard to deepen our relationship.I find it fascinating, maybe it\u2019s I\u2019m getting older -- I find it fascinating how some look at Israel today and say its success was inevitable. Why didn\u2019t everyone understand this was just inevitable? But at the outset it was anything but inevitable. It was the opposite of inevitable. Israel\u2019s very survival was against all odds. But thankfully Israel was blessed with a founding generation that understood exactly what it took to overcome those odds. So many of that generation, because of the people of the United States, I have the great honor of personally meeting and getting to know. I did not know David Ben Gurion, but I knew all but one -- every Prime Minister since that time.President Peres, you and Prime Minister Sharon are part of one of the most remarkable founding generations in the history not of this nation, but of any nation.

Inside, each has three shelves and a place to hang clothes.</p><p>Among the beneficiaries is Jorge Toledo. He was the first to receive a key to a locker on Oct. 17, 2013, designated by the United Nations as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Until recently in Locker No. 1 he had put only his \"main treasures\": photos of his two daughters and a document proving that he is a certified electrician. Now he also stores some clothes, a backpack with other garments, a pair of sneakers, and a tool bag.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Like Mr. Toledo, other less fortunate people use the lockers to store their belongings, which they previously dragged up and down the streets of Lisbon \u2013 \"the city of seven hills\" \u2013 in boxes, bags, or supermarket shopping carts.</p><p>Now, as winter sets in, they feel protected against robberies and rain.</p><p>\"The idea is to restore the sense of responsibility of the homeless, reinforce their self-esteem, and reduce the feeling of exclusion and loneliness,\" explains Mr. Paiva, who in 2007 founded the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Conversa Amiga (ACA, or Friendly Talk Association).</p><p>The \u20ac11,635 ($15,800) locker project was funded by the Lisbon municipal government. Paiva would like to start similar locker projects all over <a href=\"/tags/topic/Portugal\" title=\"Title: Portugal\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Portugal</a> and in other European cities \u2013 and even bring his idea to America.</p><p>In order to obtain and keep using a locker a homeless person has to obey several rules, which include maintaining regular contact with the ACA street team, and promising to help keep the area around the lockers clean and not use them to store illicit substances.</p><p>In Arroios, the lockers were placed close to a church and police station. It was on the stairs of St. George Church that <a href=\"/tags/topic/Toledo\" title=\"Title: Toledo\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toledo</a> used to sleep before being offered shelter in an old van. Sliding open a door of the van's cargo area, he proudly shows his mattress with its crumpled sheets.</p><p>Toledo was born in Ilha Terceira, one of the nine islands of the <a href=\"/tags/topic/Azores\" title=\"Title: Azores\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azores archipelago</a>, an autonomous region of Portugal. His late father, of whom he speaks with visible pride (\"Thanks to him, I finished secondary school\"), was an aircraft maintenance employee at a <a href=\"/tags/topic/United+States\" title=\"Title: United States\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">US</a> air base there.</p><p>Toledo's parents eventually rented their house to a US military officer and moved with their four children (two boys and two girls) to the Azores city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. Coincidentally, Paiva was born there in 1981.</p><p>But Paiva and Toledo never met in the Azores. They first encountered each other in Lisbon in 2010. One year later, the architect was awarded a community prize from Do Something (Portugal), a US organization supporting the charitable projects of younger adults.</p><p>Paiva had started volunteering at age 14. His first effort, with the cooperation of firefighters, was \"to save a cat trapped on the top of a telephone pole,\" he says. Instead of being grateful, the animal acted with fury toward his benefactor. That taught Paiva an early lesson.</p><p>\"This also happens with homeless people \u2013 not all of them are docile,\" he says. \"At daytime, they are frequently neglected; at night, when helpers come, they can be aggressive just to reassert their dignity.</p><p>\"We are not taking care of a homogenous population. There are so many different cases that it is wrong to address them\" as though they are all alike, he says.</p><p>The ACA has a yearly budget of around \u20ac20,000 ($27,000) and about 70 regular volunteers. During 2012 it managed to assist more than 6,100 people \u2013 not all of them homeless.</p><p>On World Diabetes Day (Nov. 14) a group of ACA volunteers, among them a doctor and a nurse, taught a group of men and women at a senior center the best way to care for their feet. The local Roman Catholic Church, which runs the senior center, is one of 17 ACA partners.</p><p>Elsewhere, in a poor neighborhood two young women from ACA were helping a group of children do their homework. Their parents, most of them destitute, pay only a small fee.</p><p>Paiva's dedication to the homeless is related to his childhood in the Azores.</p><p>\"I used to play by inventing and creating things,\" he says. \"My family is not rich, and I had to struggle to have what I wanted, whether it was a toy or a university degree.\"</p><p>When he was 9 years old, he offered bread to an impoverished neighbor, who rejected the gift. Paiva wondered why.</p><p>The answer arrived in 2005. It was Christmas Eve. He was delivering food and clothes to the homeless and was surprised when they told him what they needed most: someone to listen to them. They needed a friend.</p><p>\"My thoughts were, 'I do not have the means to offer a house to everyone, but I can share a portion of my time,' \" Paiva says. \"Then, I created an Internet page, Um sem-abrigo; Um amigo [\"One homeless; One friend\"]. Since the beginning our purpose remains the same: to diminish the isolation and marginalization of vulnerable individuals and groups.\"</p><p>He started by offering hot tea to homeless people, still a trademark of ACA volunteers. Every fortnight a different person in each ACA team prepares a large container of hot tea and serves it in paper cups.</p><p>One of the six main locations served by ACA is Gare do Oriente. At least 30 homeless people, mostly men, sleep on the cold stone benches of this central railway station, which connects the north and south of Portugal.</p><p>All of them are treated like relatives by the ACA helpers, who are easily identified by their green vests.</p><p>On a Saturday night, Hugo Martins, a young doctor who has donated backpacks with simple medical supplies for the homeless, gives two octogenarians medical advice. One of them, a widower, owns a house but moved to the station to sleep after the love of his life died five years ago.</p><p>The ACA focuses on basic needs, such as offering medical treatment free of charge, obtaining documents, or arranging for a state pension. It does not distribute soup or blankets since many other groups do that.</p><p>Working with the homeless is a remarkable personal experience, Dr. Martins says. \"I no longer deal solely with diseases but with human beings, who make a better person out of me,\" he says.</p><p>One man always waiting for the ACA volunteers, Armando Barbosa, is unemployed. But thanks to ACA he is now receiving a monthly social services allowance and learning English, and he expects to take the test to become a truck or bus driver. He still goes to the Gare do Oriente train station, where he slept for three months, but now it is only to talk.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Toledo, who received Locker No. 1, says he's never felt \"so happy.\" After two failed marriages and the loss of his father and of two friends, he arrived in Lisbon in 2009, dependent on drugs and expecting to die. \"I brought \u20ac22,000 [$30,000] and I spent all of it in less than six months on cocaine and parties,\" he recalls.</p><p>Now, sitting in a coffee shop and bakery where he helps out doing a bit of everything in exchange for meals, Toledo smiles at Paiva. He concedes that ACA is \"reintegrating him into society.\" He is saving his money for a journey across North Africa.</p><p>Paiva, his friend, is pleased.</p><p>\"If I cannot change the whole world overnight, I am sure that I can change the street where I live,\" he says. \"Probably, I will never [build] big buildings. But if someone leaves me on an isolated island I will be able to erect a city with [only] a few sticks and ropes.\"</p><p><em>\u2022 For more information, visit <a href=\"http://acamiga%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%8B.wix.com/aca-pt\" target=\"_self\">http://acamiga\u200b.wix.com/aca-pt</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga\" target=\"_self\">https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga</a> (both sites are in Portuguese).</em></p><a name=\"eztoc17833381_1\" id=\"eztoc17833381_1\"/><h2><b>Help the homeless</b></h2><p><a href=\"http://universalgiving.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>UniversalGiving</b></a> helps people give to and volunteer for top-performing charitable organizations worldwide.

They also serve as a postal address: Letters can be inserted through an outer slot. In Arroios, a neighborhood of Lisbon, stands a set of 12 metal lockers. Surrounded by old trees and newly planted bushes, the lockers represent a pilot project designed by Portuguese architect Duarte Paiva as a way to safeguard the possessions of the homeless. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition The shining yellow cabinets also serve as a postal address: Letters can be inserted through an outer slot. Inside, each has three shelves and a place to hang clothes.Among the beneficiaries is Jorge Toledo. He was the first to receive a key to a locker on Oct. 17, 2013, designated by the United Nations as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Until recently in Locker No. 1 he had put only his \"main treasures\": photos of his two daughters and a document proving that he is a certified electrician. Now he also stores some clothes, a backpack with other garments, a pair of sneakers, and a tool bag. Like Mr. Toledo, other less fortunate people use the lockers to store their belongings, which they previously dragged up and down the streets of Lisbon \u2013 \"the city of seven hills\" \u2013 in boxes, bags, or supermarket shopping carts.Now, as winter sets in, they feel protected against robberies and rain.\"The idea is to restore the sense of responsibility of the homeless, reinforce their self-esteem, and reduce the feeling of exclusion and loneliness,\" explains Mr. Paiva, who in 2007 founded the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Conversa Amiga (ACA, or Friendly Talk Association).The \u20ac11,635 ($15,800) locker project was funded by the Lisbon municipal government. Paiva would like to start similar locker projects all over Portugal and in other European cities \u2013 and even bring his idea to America.In order to obtain and keep using a locker a homeless person has to obey several rules, which include maintaining regular contact with the ACA street team, and promising to help keep the area around the lockers clean and not use them to store illicit substances.In Arroios, the lockers were placed close to a church and police station. It was on the stairs of St. George Church that Toledo used to sleep before being offered shelter in an old van. Sliding open a door of the van's cargo area, he proudly shows his mattress with its crumpled sheets.Toledo was born in Ilha Terceira, one of the nine islands of the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal. His late father, of whom he speaks with visible pride (\"Thanks to him, I finished secondary school\"), was an aircraft maintenance employee at a US air base there.Toledo's parents eventually rented their house to a US military officer and moved with their four children (two boys and two girls) to the Azores city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. Coincidentally, Paiva was born there in 1981.But Paiva and Toledo never met in the Azores. They first encountered each other in Lisbon in 2010. One year later, the architect was awarded a community prize from Do Something (Portugal), a US organization supporting the charitable projects of younger adults.Paiva had started volunteering at age 14. His first effort, with the cooperation of firefighters, was \"to save a cat trapped on the top of a telephone pole,\" he says. Instead of being grateful, the animal acted with fury toward his benefactor. That taught Paiva an early lesson.\"This also happens with homeless people \u2013 not all of them are docile,\" he says. \"At daytime, they are frequently neglected; at night, when helpers come, they can be aggressive just to reassert their dignity.\"We are not taking care of a homogenous population. There are so many different cases that it is wrong to address them\" as though they are all alike, he says.The ACA has a yearly budget of around \u20ac20,000 ($27,000) and about 70 regular volunteers. During 2012 it managed to assist more than 6,100 people \u2013 not all of them homeless.On World Diabetes Day (Nov. 14) a group of ACA volunteers, among them a doctor and a nurse, taught a group of men and women at a senior center the best way to care for their feet. The local Roman Catholic Church, which runs the senior center, is one of 17 ACA partners.Elsewhere, in a poor neighborhood two young women from ACA were helping a group of children do their homework. Their parents, most of them destitute, pay only a small fee.Paiva's dedication to the homeless is related to his childhood in the Azores.\"I used to play by inventing and creating things,\" he says. \"My family is not rich, and I had to struggle to have what I wanted, whether it was a toy or a university degree.\"When he was 9 years old, he offered bread to an impoverished neighbor, who rejected the gift. Paiva wondered why.The answer arrived in 2005. It was Christmas Eve. He was delivering food and clothes to the homeless and was surprised when they told him what they needed most: someone to listen to them. They needed a friend.\"My thoughts were, 'I do not have the means to offer a house to everyone, but I can share a portion of my time,' \" Paiva says. \"Then, I created an Internet page, Um sem-abrigo; Um amigo [\"One homeless; One friend\"]. Since the beginning our purpose remains the same: to diminish the isolation and marginalization of vulnerable individuals and groups.\"He started by offering hot tea to homeless people, still a trademark of ACA volunteers. Every fortnight a different person in each ACA team prepares a large container of hot tea and serves it in paper cups.One of the six main locations served by ACA is Gare do Oriente. At least 30 homeless people, mostly men, sleep on the cold stone benches of this central railway station, which connects the north and south of Portugal.All of them are treated like relatives by the ACA helpers, who are easily identified by their green vests.On a Saturday night, Hugo Martins, a young doctor who has donated backpacks with simple medical supplies for the homeless, gives two octogenarians medical advice. One of them, a widower, owns a house but moved to the station to sleep after the love of his life died five years ago.The ACA focuses on basic needs, such as offering medical treatment free of charge, obtaining documents, or arranging for a state pension. It does not distribute soup or blankets since many other groups do that.Working with the homeless is a remarkable personal experience, Dr. Martins says. \"I no longer deal solely with diseases but with human beings, who make a better person out of me,\" he says.One man always waiting for the ACA volunteers, Armando Barbosa, is unemployed. But thanks to ACA he is now receiving a monthly social services allowance and learning English, and he expects to take the test to become a truck or bus driver. He still goes to the Gare do Oriente train station, where he slept for three months, but now it is only to talk. Toledo, who received Locker No. 1, says he's never felt \"so happy.\" After two failed marriages and the loss of his father and of two friends, he arrived in Lisbon in 2009, dependent on drugs and expecting to die. \"I brought \u20ac22,000 [$30,000] and I spent all of it in less than six months on cocaine and parties,\" he recalls.Now, sitting in a coffee shop and bakery where he helps out doing a bit of everything in exchange for meals, Toledo smiles at Paiva. He concedes that ACA is \"reintegrating him into society.\" He is saving his money for a journey across North Africa.Paiva, his friend, is pleased.\"If I cannot change the whole world overnight, I am sure that I can change the street where I live,\" he says. \"Probably, I will never [build] big buildings. But if someone leaves me on an isolated island I will be able to erect a city with [only] a few sticks and ropes.\"\u2022 For more information, visit http://acamiga\u200b.wix.com/aca-pt or https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga (both sites are in Portuguese).Help the homelessUniversalGiving helps people give to and volunteer for top-performing charitable organizations worldwide.

Pike, a longtime congressman from New York who spearheaded an inquiry in the 1970s into accusations that the intelligence establishment had abused its power, died on Monday in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 92. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"71\" data-total-count=\"283\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">His daughter, Lois Pike Eyre, said he had entered a hospice a week ago.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"226\" data-total-count=\"509\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Over 18 years in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from a heavily Republican district on Long Island, Mr. Pike styled himself an uninhibited, independent thinker, lashing out, for example, against military profligacy.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"363\" data-total-count=\"872\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In 1975, he became chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, which began examining suspicions that the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/central_intelligence_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about the Central Intelligence Agency.\" class=\"meta-org\">Central Intelligence Agency</a> had had its hand in coups in Chile and other countries and was spying on American citizens. The inquiry paralleled one in the Senate; they were the first in which Congress looked into allegations of abuse by the C.I.A.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"294\" data-total-count=\"1166\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Pike maintained that the security agencies were inept bureaucracies that left the country vulnerable. \u201cIf an attack were to be launched on America in the very near future,\u201d he said in late 1975, \u201cit is my belief that America would not know that the attack was about to be launched.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"340\" data-total-count=\"1506\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Pike committee hearings were tempestuous and resulted in a lengthy report demanding greater congressional oversight of intelligence operations. However, the full House voted to keep the so-called Pike Report secret. It is probably best remembered for being disclosed by Daniel Schorr of CBS News and then published in The Village Voice.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"170\" data-total-count=\"1676\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Greater attention was paid to the findings of the Senate committee, which was led by Frank Church, a Democrat of Idaho. Some of its recommended reforms were carried out. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"389\" data-total-count=\"2065\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Otis Grey Pike was born on Aug. 31, 1921, in Riverhead, N.Y., on the eastern edge of Long Island. His parents died when he was still a small boy, and he was raised by relatives. He enrolled at Princeton University, then interrupted his studies to join the Marines. During World War II he was a fighter pilot in the Pacific, flying 120 missions. He completed his degree after his discharge.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"319\" data-total-count=\"2384\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Politics captured his imagination when he was 14, he said, after he had learned from his sister about a family who owned a large farm but had nothing for Sunday dinner but boiled potatoes. After graduating from Columbia University Law School in 1948, he practiced law in his hometown and became a justice of the peace. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"258\" data-total-count=\"2642\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">His first campaign for a House seat, in 1958, failed, but he was elected two years later, despite being a Democrat in a Republican district. He once quipped, \u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019m surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by Republicans.\u201d </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"424\" data-total-count=\"3066\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">A tall, wavy-haired man who wore bow ties exclusively, he attracted attention in 1967 when he complained that the Defense Department was paying absurd amounts of money for spare parts like nuts and washers obtainable at a small fraction of the cost through mail-order catalogs. Displaying one part at a news conference, he said, \u201cThis is called precision shafting.\u201d The Pentagon ultimately revamped its buying protocol. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"230\" data-total-count=\"3296\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In 1969, Mr. Pike conducted a House subcommittee investigation into the seizure of the intelligence ship Pueblo by North Koreans, concluding that \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d existed in the United States military command structure. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"180\" data-total-count=\"3476\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In all, Mr. Pike served for nine terms before choosing not to run for re-election in 1978.

Pike, 92, Dies; Long Island Congressman Took On C.I.A. Representative Otis G. Pike, a Long Island Democrat and chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, in 1975. George Tames/The New York Times Otis G. Pike, a longtime congressman from New York who spearheaded an inquiry in the 1970s into accusations that the intelligence establishment had abused its power, died on Monday in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 92. His daughter, Lois Pike Eyre, said he had entered a hospice a week ago.Over 18 years in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from a heavily Republican district on Long Island, Mr. Pike styled himself an uninhibited, independent thinker, lashing out, for example, against military profligacy.In 1975, he became chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, which began examining suspicions that the Central Intelligence Agency had had its hand in coups in Chile and other countries and was spying on American citizens. The inquiry paralleled one in the Senate; they were the first in which Congress looked into allegations of abuse by the C.I.A.Mr. Pike maintained that the security agencies were inept bureaucracies that left the country vulnerable. \u201cIf an attack were to be launched on America in the very near future,\u201d he said in late 1975, \u201cit is my belief that America would not know that the attack was about to be launched.\u201dThe Pike committee hearings were tempestuous and resulted in a lengthy report demanding greater congressional oversight of intelligence operations. However, the full House voted to keep the so-called Pike Report secret. It is probably best remembered for being disclosed by Daniel Schorr of CBS News and then published in The Village Voice.Greater attention was paid to the findings of the Senate committee, which was led by Frank Church, a Democrat of Idaho. Some of its recommended reforms were carried out. Otis Grey Pike was born on Aug. 31, 1921, in Riverhead, N.Y., on the eastern edge of Long Island. His parents died when he was still a small boy, and he was raised by relatives. He enrolled at Princeton University, then interrupted his studies to join the Marines. During World War II he was a fighter pilot in the Pacific, flying 120 missions. He completed his degree after his discharge.Politics captured his imagination when he was 14, he said, after he had learned from his sister about a family who owned a large farm but had nothing for Sunday dinner but boiled potatoes. After graduating from Columbia University Law School in 1948, he practiced law in his hometown and became a justice of the peace. His first campaign for a House seat, in 1958, failed, but he was elected two years later, despite being a Democrat in a Republican district. He once quipped, \u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019m surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by Republicans.\u201d A tall, wavy-haired man who wore bow ties exclusively, he attracted attention in 1967 when he complained that the Defense Department was paying absurd amounts of money for spare parts like nuts and washers obtainable at a small fraction of the cost through mail-order catalogs. Displaying one part at a news conference, he said, \u201cThis is called precision shafting.\u201d The Pentagon ultimately revamped its buying protocol. In 1969, Mr. Pike conducted a House subcommittee investigation into the seizure of the intelligence ship Pueblo by North Koreans, concluding that \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d existed in the United States military command structure. In all, Mr. Pike served for nine terms before choosing not to run for re-election in 1978. He quoted the soccer player Pel\u00e9: \u201cA man can\u2019t play one game all his life.\u201d After leaving Congress, he wrote a column for the Newhouse Newspapers for 20 years.Mr. Pike\u2019s first wife, Doris Orth, died in 1996, and a son, Robert, died in 2010. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his second wife, Barbe Bonjour Pike; a son, Douglas; and two grandchildren.One of his memorable achievements was when he thwarted a bill with a single comical speech on the House floor. The bill would have awarded $14 million in flight pay to admirals and generals who spent their time not in cockpits but sitting at desks.Standing up on the House floor to criticize the legislation, Mr. Pike spoke with his arms spread and swaying like the wings of a plane, as if he were flying.

The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure.</p>\n<p>Ms. Hattam, <a href=\"http://meredithhattam.com/about/\">who now lives in Brooklyn</a>, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties.<br/>\n<span id=\"more-5027\"/><br/>\nHere is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store.

One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men.

The insider essay on modeling in China opens with the American author, Meredith Hattam, sitting on a train from Chengdu to Beijing with a 16\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Ukrainian friend, Lana. The friend is eating a hard\u00ad-boiled egg. Ms. Hattam makes it clear that eggs are all Lana will eat for the next 10 days because the modeling agency in Beijing that employs the two of them has cut Lana\u2019s weekly allowance due to her weight. Lana had violated the strict measurement standards laid out in her three\u00ad-month modeling contract.

It is not a glamorous scene, and it sets the stage for the rest of Ms. Hattam\u2019s account of working for several months for an agency in Beijing owned by a former Ukrainian model. The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure. Ms. Hattam, who now lives in Brooklyn, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties. Here is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked: For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store. Our handlers request that we salute every hour, switching into evening gowns during intervals. For that job, the daily pay was 3,000 renmimbi, or about $500. Forty percent went to the agency and 10 percent to the scout, which is not unusual. By the time we leave China, we\u2019ll have earned nothing at all. In Beijing, Ms. Hattam lived in a cramped apartment with 12 other models, most of them under 18 and from countries in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Of the 13 roommates, there were nine girls and four boys. Most jobs lasted nine hours a day and required travel to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, cities central to China\u2019s fashion industry. Some jobs did not involve modeling work per se. One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men. The woman declined and was fired from the agency. Ms. Hattam wrote: Sex will always quietly surround those who make a career selling their image. But in Asia, it\u2019s pervasive: model life, if one so chooses, becomes a hypersexual nightscape of drugs and promiscuity.

But only a few months after the end of the five-year trial, \ufffdz has now turned against his former sponsor.</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\tShortly before Christmas, police arrested more than 50 suspects, including politicians with the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), influential businesspeople, and the sons of three cabinet ministers. The investigations were initiated by \ufffdz, who was subsequently taken off the case. The scandal has taken Erdogan into the most serious crisis of his nearly 11 years in office. The corruption scandal within his inner circle is jeopardizing the power of the AKP and threatens to <a href=\"/international/europe/power-struggle-splits-erdogan-ruling-akp-party-in-turkey-a-917823.html\" title=\"tear it apart\" class=\"text-link-int\">tear it apart</a> -- and that in an election year, in which Erdogan apparently wants to be elected president.</p>\n\n<p>The ministers of economics, the interior and urban development resigned on Dec. 25, after the arrest of their sons, who allegedly accepted bribes for providing building permits and public contracts. The next day, Erdogan fired seven other ministers, filling their posts with his confidants.</p>\n\n<p>Several senior lawmakers, as well as the head of the state-owned Halkbank, who allegedly orchestrated oil deals with Iran, were also arrested. They are accused of circumventing sanctions against Tehran that prohibit monetary transactions with Iranian banks by paying several billion euros worth of gold in return for oil. When the police raided the bank head's home, they found $4.5 million (\u00803.3 million) in shoeboxes. But this is probably only the beginning of greater turmoil. Even <a href=\"/international/topic/recep_tayyip_erdogan/\" title=\"Erdogan\" class=\"text-link-int\">Erdogan</a> himself is becoming increasingly caught up in the corruption scandal. The urban development minister who had resigned, Erdogan Bayraktar, has called upon the prime minister to step down as well. Bayraktar claimed that he had approved the construction projects in question at Erdogan's instruction.</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Further Arrests in the Pipeline</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>Investigators are apparently planning further arrests, with a list of suspects that includes Erdogan's son Bilal. The 32-year-old is the founder and a board member of the influential T\ufffdrgev Foundation, which acquired a government property in Istanbul's Fatih district at a very favorable price, allegedly paying about \u00803 million in bribes in return.</p>\n\n<p>A summons for Bilal Erdogan, signed by Istanbul public prosecutor Muammer Akka, has since been published. But police officers refused to arrest either him or a number of AKP lawmakers, probably on instructions from the political arena. Akka was also removed from the case. In a statement last Thursday, he said: \"My investigations were blocked. The judiciary was apparently put under pressure.\"</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Erdogan is trying to paint the scandal as a conspiracy against his government. He blames it on a \"gang\" that aims to harm <a href=\"/international/topic/turkey/\" title=\"Turkey\" class=\"text-link-int\">Turkey</a>. In a televised address on Jan. 1, Erdogan called on his fellow Turks to help fight what he called a plot by foreign-backed elements. \"I invite every one of our 76 million people to stand up for themselves, to defend democracy and to be as one against these ugly attacks on our country,\" he said. But even Erdogan's supporters are irritated by his tirades. And the louder he gets, the clearer it becomes that the once popular premier is fighting for his political future.</p>\n\n<p>Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul, came into office on the promise of putting an end to the cronyism of his predecessors. It helped get him elected in 2002 and has seen his government returned to office two times since then. But the AKP is not governing as cleanly as Erdogan claimed. It has long been plagued by allegations of corruption. In the embassy cables published by WikiLeaks in 2010, US diplomats reported \"corruption at all levels\" in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>'No One Wanted to Listen'</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\"We have addressed the subject of corruption within the government for years, but no one wanted to listen,\" says Aye Danioglu, a member of parliament for the opposition party, the CHP. \"It finally took a dispute within the Islamic camp to uncover the dirt of the past few years.\"</p>\n\n<p>The accusations have never been this detailed, nor have they been this dangerous for the prime minister.

His supporters have established schools, media companies, hospitals and companies worldwide. The G\ufffdlen community seeks to portray itself as a civil society movement that primarily promotes education. But former members describe the community as hierarchical, political and Islamist.</p>\n\n<p>G\ufffdlen and Erdogan long enjoyed a successful cooperative relationship. G\ufffdlen secured votes for the premier, while Erdogan protected the community's business dealings. With Erdogan's patronage, G\ufffdlen supporters secured key positions with the police and in the judiciary. In the Ergenekon trial, G\ufffdlen and Erdogan collaborated to bring down their chief adversaries: the military and the secular opposition.</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>A 'Declaration of War'</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>Zekeriya \ufffdz, considered a G\ufffdlen supporter, was the chief prosecutor in the trial, the largest in recent Turkish history. The accused allegedly planned terrorist attacks to overthrow the government. Observers criticized the trial, which ended in August 2013 after five years, calling it a farce. Details from the trial were regularly leaked to media organizations owned by the G\ufffdlen movement, and regime critics were publicly denounced. </p>\n\n<p>In recent months, however, the alliance has begun to crumble. G\ufffdlen's supporters had apparently become too powerful for Erdogan. At the same time, he obviously came to perceive them as disloyal, dismissing a number of officials aligned with the community. G\ufffdlen supporters in the judiciary subsequently attempted to prosecute the intelligence chief, an important confidant of the prime minister, but were unsuccessful. In November, Erdogan announced that G\ufffdlen tutoring centers were to be shut down. The educational facilities prepare pupils for university entrance examinations and are an important source of income for the movement. The newspaper <i>H\ufffdrriyet</i> called the move a \"declaration of war.\"</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, the investigations can arguably also be seen as the G\ufffdlen movement's attempt to exact revenge on the prime minister. Erdogan calls it a \"very dirty operation\" and accuses G\ufffdlen supporters of trying to establish a \"state within the state.\" G\ufffdlen replied with a video address, in which he said: \"May God bring fire onto the houses of those who do not see the thief, but instead persecute those who are hunting the thief.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is the second time that Erdogan has come under fire recently. In the summer, more than three million people <a href=\"/international/world/profile-of-turkish-protest-movemet-icon-erdem-guenduez-a-920577.html\" title=\"protested\" class=\"text-link-int\">protested</a> for months against the redevelopment of Gezi Park in Istanbul.

He has now replaced many capable advisers with loyal yes-men. Success makes some politicians more relaxed, but in recent years Erdogan has, in many respects, developed into precisely the type of autocratic ruler he once vowed to abolish. Critics have been locked away under Erdogan's rule. Turkey has more journalists and supposed terror suspects in prison than anywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>AKP at Risk</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>Erdogan reacted obstinately to the <a href=\"/international/business/erdogan-endangering-economy-with-financial-sector-witch-hunt-a-917370.html\" title=\"protests\" class=\"text-link-int\">protests</a> in the summer, berating his critics as \"bums\" and having his security forces fire tear gas at them. He has also proved to be relentless in the current crisis. Some 500 police officers have been transferred, and Erdogan also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to gain control over investigations by decree. But in contrast to the Gezi protests, this time Erdogan will not be able to bring the crisis under control by taking a tough approach. It is already becoming clear that the scandal could break apart his party. </p>\n\n<p>\n\n\tErdogan's goal of having himself elected president in the summer is becoming more and more tenuous. He would like to endow the position with significantly more power, but he is now unlikely to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament. Under the rules of Erdogan's AK party, he is prohibited from seeking an additional term as prime minister.

On the black market, where Argentina's currency is even weaker, the peso dropped 6 percent Thursday to 13 per dollar.The sharp depreciation is likely due to a new government strategy of seeking a sudden devaluation instead of a gradual one, said Juan Pablo Ronderos of economic consulting firm abeceb.com.\"There was a first sign of this change on Tuesday because the central bank didn't show up (to intervene) until midday, and on Wednesday and today it just disappeared from the market,\" Ronderos said. \"The gradual devaluation wasn't working because the central bank kept on sacrificing lots of its reserves and it kept on being reflected on consumer prices.\"Analysts expect Argentina's inflation to reach more than 30 percent this year, the second highest rate in Latin America after Venezuela.\"The sharp drop will aggravate inflation, although the impact may be mitigated by the fact that some imports will already be purchased at the much weaker black market exchange rate,\" Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics in London, said in a research note.\"The bigger picture, though, is that the economic mismanagement of the past decade has once again pushed the country to the brink of a balance of payments crisis,\" Shearing wrote.Critics of the left-leaning government of President Cristina Kirchner blame economic problems on its higher spending on social programs, expansion of business regulation and nationalisation of some companies.Argentina has been kept from global credit markets since defaulting on its debt during its 2001-2002 financial crisis. So officials have been trying to keep dollars in the country for the central bank to use to pay off government debts.But the bank's reserves have plunged to $29 billion, the lowest level in more than seven years despite increasingly restrictive currency controls meant to stem capital flight.The controls make it nearly impossible to legally trade pesos for dollars, but many Argentines have turned to black market money changers to obtain dollars.Many in the country are haunted by memories of the financial crisis, when banks froze deposits and the currency lost value, and they want dollars to keep in emergency stashes.", "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 01:34:50 GMT", "tags": ["theguardian.com", "Argentina", "Americas", "News", "Currencies", "Business", "World news"]}, {"author": "By JENNIFER MEDINA", "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"articleSpanImage\"><span itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/08/us/08sheriff_span/08sheriff_span-articleLarge.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n<img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/08/us/08sheriff_span/08sheriff_span-articleLarge.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/08/us/08sheriff_span/08sheriff_span-articleLarge.jpg\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"identifier\" content=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/08/us/08sheriff_span/08sheriff_span-articleLarge.jpg\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"600\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"400\"/>\n<p itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\" class=\"credit\">Monica Almeida/The New York Times</p>\n<p itemprop=\"description\" class=\"caption\">Lee Baca, the sheriff of Los Angeles, was expected to face a fierce battle for re-election for a fifth term this year. </p>\n</span>\n</div>  \n<div class=\"articleBody\">\n<span itemprop=\"copyrightHolder provider sourceOrganization\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\" itemid=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">\n<meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"The New York Times Company\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"http://www.nytco.com/\"/>\n<meta itemprop=\"tickerSymbol\" content=\"NYSE NYT\"/>\n</span>\n<meta itemprop=\"copyrightYear\" content=\"2014\"/>\n\n\n\n\n<nyt_text>\n\n<nyt_correction_top>\n</nyt_correction_top>\n    <p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The embattled sheriff of Los Angeles, Lee Baca, announced Tuesday that he will retire at the end of the month and not seek re-election.

The friend is eating a hard\u00ad-boiled egg. Ms. Hattam makes it clear that eggs are all Lana will eat for the next 10 days because the modeling agency in Beijing that employs the two of them has cut Lana\u2019s weekly allowance due to her weight. Lana had violated the strict measurement standards laid out in her three\u00ad-month modeling contract.</p>\n<p>It is not a glamorous scene, and it sets the stage for the rest of Ms. Hattam\u2019s account of working for several months for an agency in Beijing owned by a former Ukrainian model. The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure.</p>\n<p>Ms. Hattam, <a href=\"http://meredithhattam.com/about/\">who now lives in Brooklyn</a>, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties.<br/>\n<span id=\"more-5027\"/><br/>\nHere is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store. Our handlers request that we salute every hour, switching into evening gowns during intervals.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For that job, the daily pay was 3,000 renmimbi, or about $500. Forty percent went to the agency and 10 percent to the scout, which is not unusual.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>By the time we leave China, we\u2019ll have earned nothing at all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In Beijing, Ms. Hattam lived in a cramped apartment with 12 other models, most of them under 18 and from countries in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Of the 13 roommates, there were nine girls and four boys.</p>\n<p>Most jobs lasted nine hours a day and required travel to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, cities central to China\u2019s fashion industry.</p>\n<p>Some jobs did not involve modeling work per se. One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men. The woman declined and was fired from the agency. Ms. Hattam wrote:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Sex will always quietly surround those who make a career selling their image.

The friend is eating a hard\u00ad-boiled egg. Ms. Hattam makes it clear that eggs are all Lana will eat for the next 10 days because the modeling agency in Beijing that employs the two of them has cut Lana\u2019s weekly allowance due to her weight. Lana had violated the strict measurement standards laid out in her three\u00ad-month modeling contract. It is not a glamorous scene, and it sets the stage for the rest of Ms. Hattam\u2019s account of working for several months for an agency in Beijing owned by a former Ukrainian model. The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure. Ms. Hattam, who now lives in Brooklyn, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties. Here is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked: For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store. Our handlers request that we salute every hour, switching into evening gowns during intervals. For that job, the daily pay was 3,000 renmimbi, or about $500. Forty percent went to the agency and 10 percent to the scout, which is not unusual. By the time we leave China, we\u2019ll have earned nothing at all. In Beijing, Ms. Hattam lived in a cramped apartment with 12 other models, most of them under 18 and from countries in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Of the 13 roommates, there were nine girls and four boys. Most jobs lasted nine hours a day and required travel to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, cities central to China\u2019s fashion industry. Some jobs did not involve modeling work per se. One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men. The woman declined and was fired from the agency. Ms. Hattam wrote: Sex will always quietly surround those who make a career selling their image. But in Asia, it\u2019s pervasive: model life, if one so chooses, becomes a hypersexual nightscape of drugs and promiscuity. Older male models frequently sleep with teenagers (whom they often live with), and at clubs prostitution is euphemistically referred to as \u201cworking the after\u00ad-party.\u201d One of Ms. Hattam\u2019s friends, a Canadian model, was asked by the owner of a popular Beijing nightclub to work such a party.

Andrew M. Cuomo this fall, the state\u2019s Republican Party may have, at least temporarily, found a talking point: comments by the governor that candidates who are \u201cextreme conservatives\u201d \u2014 which he defined as pro-assault weapon and anti-abortion \u2014 have \u201cno place in the state of New York.\u201d Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remarks, made on a radio program on Friday, have been bouncing around Republican circles and the airwaves of Fox News for several days, eliciting follow-up comments from the governor\u2019s office and his legal team, but no apology as of yet. And that has given the state party, and conservative pundits like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, additional ammunition against the governor, a Democrat who is seeking a second term this year.\u201cI think the governor is a bully,\u201d said Assemblyman Steven F. McLaughlin, a Republican who represents the Albany area. \u201cAn arrogant, elitist bully.\u201d Mr. McLaughlin was one of several Republican leaders who attacked the governor at a fund-raiser here on Tuesday night.\u201cIn all of my life, I have never seen a finer group of extremists in one room,\u201d said Rob Astorino, a Republican who recently won a second term as the Westchester County executive. He added that the crowd should have fun before \u201cwe are told to leave the state.\u201d Mr. Astorino, a potential candidate for governor, continued his criticism during a visit to the State Capitol on Wednesday, calling the comments \u201cextremely disconcerting\u201d and \u201cobnoxious\u201d and asking the governor to take responsibility. \u201cHe\u2019s a big boy,\u201d Mr. Astorino said. \u201cHe should own up to it.\u201d Mr. Cuomo made his comments during a discussion of \u201cextreme Republicans versus moderate Republicans\u201d in Washington, adding that similar internal discord can be seen in New York. \u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Mr. Cuomo, speaking of potential Republican candidates. \u201cAre they these extreme conservatives, who are right-to-life, pro-assault weapon, antigay, is that who they are? Because if that is who they are, and if they are the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York. Because that is not who New Yorkers are.\u201d Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office has twice responded to the backlash. Mylan L. Denerstein, the governor\u2019s counsel, answered criticism from The New York Post with a statement saying the remarks had been misconstrued. \u201cThe governor has never demonized the opposition to his gun law nor stance on protecting choice nor marriage equality,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Cuomo is \u201ca gun owner and a Catholic.\u201dBut Roman Catholic leaders were not exactly thrilled with Mr. Cuomo, either. On Tuesday, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said during a radio broadcast that the governor\u2019s remarks were \u201cmost unfortunate at best.\u201d \u201cAre there pro-lifers who are extremist?\u201d Cardinal Dolan added. \u201cYes, there are. But I think they are a distinct minority.\u201d National conservatives also seemed to be relishing a chance to criticize the governor, who has $33 million in his campaign coffers and is heading to Los Angeles on Thursday for a celebrity fund-raiser. Mr. Hannity said he wanted to move his radio show out of New York, while Mr. Beck wrote an open letter touching on the internments of Japanese-Americans and the massacre at Wounded Knee before asking Mr. Cuomo if he wanted to \u201cbuild a tyranny here in New York.\u201d Matt Wing, a spokesman for the governor, said on Wednesday that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s comments had been \u201crepeatedly taken out of context \u2014 what he actually said was that the state is a moderate political state with all views welcome.\u201dFor the time being, however, Republican aspirants seemed to be enjoying the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with progressives on hardly anything,\u201d said Mr. McLaughlin, who also has ambitions to be governor. \u201cBut I would never say that they have no place in the state of New York.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 23, 2014, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Comment by Cuomo Outrages Republicans.

Since the U.S. has spent the last 12 years blasting dollars into Afghanistan, \u201cfollowing the money\u201d is a task on the order of investigating grains of sand in the desert. Still, Sopko and his team have proven to be uncompromising, inexhaustible, and enormously effective. His office is independent; he is not beholden to the usual feudal lords in Washington. As Congress has decided to sit this war out, Sopko has proven to be the conflict\u2019s only real oversight mechanism.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ad adIn-article\" id=\"adIn-article3\">\n<noscript><div><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dd-b-grady%26title%3Dthe-looming-narco-state-in-afghanistan%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=53361654&amp;tile=3\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dd-b-grady%26title%3Dthe-looming-narco-state-in-afghanistan%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=53361654&amp;tile=3\" alt=\"\"/></a></div></noscript>\n</div><p>Since taking charge in 2012, he\u2019s <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/253258/how-one-inspector-general-is-fighting-fraud-and-waste-in-afghanistan\">uncovered everything</a> from $230 million in missing spare parts to spending on diesel running $500 per gallon (when the going rate was around $5 per gallon). Thanks to Sopko, American taxpayers learned that they bought $200,000 thermostats for air conditioners in a small medical clinic that was never completed\u2014and according to the Afghan government, was probably never going to be used. And that\u2019s just in the areas to which he has access. Because of security concerns, by next year his office will be restricted to a mere 21 percent of the country.</p>\n\n<p>And according to Sopko\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR-14-21-TY.pdf\">congressional testimony</a>, things are bad. Really bad.</p>\n\n<p>Since the fall of the Taliban government at the start of the war, the United States has invested $10 billion to fight the Afghan drug trade, through efforts such as ending poppy cultivation, halting the manufacture of narcotics, establishing drug treatment programs, and building a robust counternarcotics police force and criminal justice system. This might be money well spent, as 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium originates in Afghanistan. No effort to build a stable nation there can succeed amid the hurricane forces of financial and institutional corruption that come with a thriving drug trade.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">\u201cMore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d</aside><p>But 12 years and $10 billion later, according to Sopko\u2019s testimony, \u201cAfghan farmers are growing more opium poppies today than at any time in their modern history,\u201d and despite the \u201cmammoth investment\u201d of American dollars and blood, \u201cmore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Still, the optimist might argue, good policies under hard conditions take time to bear fruit. So five years after President Obama assumed decisive control over our strategy in Afghanistan and <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/incredible-expanding-afghan-war\">tripled</a> the number of U.S. service members in that war, are his efforts finally set to pay dividends? Said Sopko: \u201cIn the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond.\u201d As a result, \u201cAll of the fragile gains we have made over the last twelve years on women\u2019s issues, health, education, rule of law, and governance are now, more than ever, in jeopardy of being wiped out by the narcotics trade which not only supports the insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One-third of the Taliban\u2019s funding is thought to come from opium. And though U.S. officials have remained fixed in the denial stage of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model, claiming that we can work with elements of the Taliban, the news remains bleak all the same. According to Sopko, \u201cIt is widely thought that every drug organization supports or works with insurgents in Afghanistan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The exhausted American might wonder: <em>Why does it matter?</em> <em>With the litany of problems in Afghanistan, why should we care about fields of pink flowers and the drugs they yield?</em> This is a fair question, but assumes that the drug trade is an island unto itself. Not so, according to the inspector general. \u201cOpium cultivation and insecurity go hand in hand,\u201d the report noted. \u201cAbout 89% of total poppy cultivation this year occurred in Afghanistan\u2019s southern and western regions, where insurgents and criminal networks are strongest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the problem is spreading. Nangarhar, the eastern province in Afghanistan whose capital is Jalalabad, was declared \u201cpoppy free\u201d in 2008 and had been hailed as a model province. In the span of one year, however\u2014from 2012 to 2013\u2014poppy cultivation has increased <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/documents/crop-monitoring/Afghanistan/Afghan_report_Summary_Findings_2013.pdf\">500 percent</a>, now covering 15,719 hectares of the province.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to make the argument that the United States has ever waged a drug war effectively, and our work in Afghanistan is no exception to that. In 2002, we had a sweep-and-destroy policy for poppy fields in Afghanistan that yielded little success. As the late Richard Holbrooke, America\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/asia/28holbrooke.html?_r=0\">said</a> in 2009, \u201c[Those policies] did not result in any damage to the Taliban, but they put farmers out of work and they alienated people and drove people into the arms of the Taliban.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A more sensible policy was thus implemented, in which the U.S. would encourage and assist farmers in planting alternative crops such as saffron and grapes. Executed in parallel were training programs to establish an Afghan equivalent of the Drug Enforcement Administration; drug interdiction programs to get drugs off the black market; and the use of forensic accounting to squeeze Taliban revenues at their sources. At the local level, basic security measures were implemented to provide law-and-order in villages and towns, and rehab clinics were established to help addicts. In other words, the U.S. led a full-spectrum effort to provide a better life for the average Afghan, which would in turn make poppy cultivation less appealing. \u201cNonetheless,\u201d said Sopko, \u201con my last trip to Afghanistan no one at the Embassy could convincingly explain to me how the U.S. government counternarcotics efforts are making a meaningful impact on the narcotics trade or how they will have a significant impact after the 2014 transition.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Surprised? So was Sopko. \u201cI was astonished to find that the counternarcotics effort does not seem to be a top priority during this critical transition period and beyond,\u201d he wrote. Given the nature of narcotics as a sustaining force for the insurgency, both in terms of funding and as leverage over the Afghan populace, one would think any plan for withdrawal would make counternarcotics central to a lasting (or, at least, plausible) strategy for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Even granting a pass to the execution and effectiveness of our counternarcotics program, as the inspector general noted, \u201cthe United States does not have a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy even though Afghanistan is universally recognized as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

Afghan farmers work at a poppy field in Jalalabad province, on May 5, 2012. (Reuters/Parwiz)Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, offered a grim assessment of the war-torn country\u2014and revealed startling details about America\u2019s hapless reconstruction efforts there. Few have a job as challenging as Sopko\u2019s. As the inspector general, he must study our actions and spending, and uncover and investigate examples of fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption. Since the U.S. has spent the last 12 years blasting dollars into Afghanistan, \u201cfollowing the money\u201d is a task on the order of investigating grains of sand in the desert. Still, Sopko and his team have proven to be uncompromising, inexhaustible, and enormously effective. His office is independent; he is not beholden to the usual feudal lords in Washington. As Congress has decided to sit this war out, Sopko has proven to be the conflict\u2019s only real oversight mechanism. Since taking charge in 2012, he\u2019s uncovered everything from $230 million in missing spare parts to spending on diesel running $500 per gallon (when the going rate was around $5 per gallon). Thanks to Sopko, American taxpayers learned that they bought $200,000 thermostats for air conditioners in a small medical clinic that was never completed\u2014and according to the Afghan government, was probably never going to be used. And that\u2019s just in the areas to which he has access. Because of security concerns, by next year his office will be restricted to a mere 21 percent of the country. And according to Sopko\u2019s congressional testimony, things are bad. Really bad. Since the fall of the Taliban government at the start of the war, the United States has invested $10 billion to fight the Afghan drug trade, through efforts such as ending poppy cultivation, halting the manufacture of narcotics, establishing drug treatment programs, and building a robust counternarcotics police force and criminal justice system. This might be money well spent, as 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium originates in Afghanistan. No effort to build a stable nation there can succeed amid the hurricane forces of financial and institutional corruption that come with a thriving drug trade. \u201cMore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201dBut 12 years and $10 billion later, according to Sopko\u2019s testimony, \u201cAfghan farmers are growing more opium poppies today than at any time in their modern history,\u201d and despite the \u201cmammoth investment\u201d of American dollars and blood, \u201cmore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d Still, the optimist might argue, good policies under hard conditions take time to bear fruit. So five years after President Obama assumed decisive control over our strategy in Afghanistan and tripled the number of U.S. service members in that war, are his efforts finally set to pay dividends? Said Sopko: \u201cIn the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond.\u201d As a result, \u201cAll of the fragile gains we have made over the last twelve years on women\u2019s issues, health, education, rule of law, and governance are now, more than ever, in jeopardy of being wiped out by the narcotics trade which not only supports the insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption.\u201d One-third of the Taliban\u2019s funding is thought to come from opium. And though U.S. officials have remained fixed in the denial stage of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model, claiming that we can work with elements of the Taliban, the news remains bleak all the same. According to Sopko, \u201cIt is widely thought that every drug organization supports or works with insurgents in Afghanistan.\u201d The exhausted American might wonder: Why does it matter? With the litany of problems in Afghanistan, why should we care about fields of pink flowers and the drugs they yield? This is a fair question, but assumes that the drug trade is an island unto itself. Not so, according to the inspector general. \u201cOpium cultivation and insecurity go hand in hand,\u201d the report noted. \u201cAbout 89% of total poppy cultivation this year occurred in Afghanistan\u2019s southern and western regions, where insurgents and criminal networks are strongest.\u201d And the problem is spreading. Nangarhar, the eastern province in Afghanistan whose capital is Jalalabad, was declared \u201cpoppy free\u201d in 2008 and had been hailed as a model province. In the span of one year, however\u2014from 2012 to 2013\u2014poppy cultivation has increased 500 percent, now covering 15,719 hectares of the province. *** It\u2019s hard to make the argument that the United States has ever waged a drug war effectively, and our work in Afghanistan is no exception to that.

Should Mr. Modi become prime minister, a strong possibility, the Khobragade imbroglio may seem like a much lesser embarrassment for the bilateral relationship.", "published": "", "tags": null}, {"author": "", "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"badgetext hide hidden\">&#13;\n\t&#13;\n    &#13;\n    <div id=\"echo-culture_connoisseur\" class=\"echo-badge-info\">&#13;\n    <p class=\"marker echo-item-user-culture_connoisseur\"/><p class=\"title\">Culture Connoisseur Badge</p>&#13;\n    <p>Culture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.</p>&#13;\n    <p class=\"echo-badge-info-link\"><a target=\"_badgeinfo\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html\">More about badges</a> | <a target=\"_badgeinfo\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html\">Request a badge</a></p>&#13;\n    </div>    &#13;\n    &#13;\n\t&#13;\n&#13;\n    <div id=\"echo-top_local\" class=\"echo-badge-info\">&#13;\n    <p class=\"marker echo-item-user-top_local\"/><p class=\"title\">Washingtologist Badge</p>&#13;\n    <p>Washingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.</p>&#13;\n    <p class=\"echo-badge-info-link\"><a target=\"_badgeinfo\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html\">More about badges</a> | <a target=\"_badgeinfo\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html\">Request a badge</a></p>&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    <div id=\"echo-staff\" class=\"echo-badge-info\">&#13;\n    <p class=\"marker echo-item-user-staff\"/><p class=\"title\">Post Writer Badge</p>&#13;\n    <p>This commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.</p>&#13;\n    </div>&#13;\n&#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n        &#13;\n    &#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n    <div id=\"echo-post_contributor\" class=\"echo-badge-info\">&#13;\n    <p class=\"marker echo-item-user-post_contributor\"/><p class=\"title\">Post Contributor Badge</p>&#13;\n    <p>This commenter is a Washington Post contributor.

The protesters had denounced the prosecution of the three men as politically motivated and a \u201cshow trial\u201d and pointed to evidence showing that the Boryspil City Council had voted to remove the Lenin statue even before the alleged plot was discovered. About 100 protesters had gathered at the courthouse in Kiev for the verdict. The clashes began after the three defendants were sentenced to six years in prison. Among the injured was Yuri V. Lutsenko, a former interior minister and an outspoken opposition leader who helped coordinate the recent mass demonstrations in central Kiev against the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich. Local news agencies reported that Mr. Lutsenko had been knocked unconscious. Mr. Lutsenko, who was also an organizer of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is the leader of an opposition party called the Third Ukrainian Republic.

He\u2019d glance at the nuts and bolts scattered on the floor and in a few minutes \u2026 viola! Everything fit perfectly. Each time, my husband and I would smile at each other sheepishly. My husband was everything to me, but he didn\u2019t have a handy bone in his body. For that matter, neither did I. Can you believe this guy? we\u2019d say to each other. He actually liked doing this stuff.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"963\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">We\u2019d insist on paying him for larger jobs and he charged a reasonable rate, a friend\u2019s discount you could call it. The work he did was always professional quality.

When he inherited tools and needed a place to store them we offered our two-car garage and they filled it, leaving just enough room for our lawn mower. We let him store other belongings until he built his own garage, which took a year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"251\" data-total-count=\"1760\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Eventually, we struck a deal: I\u2019d cook; he\u2019d fix.

He\u2019d keep us posted so we wouldn\u2019t say the wrong thing: \u201cThere\u2019s another girl coming this weekend,\u201d he\u2019d say. It bothered us that when the regular girlfriend visited, he let her work like a mule. She\u2019d drag out the lawn furniture and beat the carpet with a broom. \u201cThis guy\u2019s too much,\u201d my husband would say.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"197\" data-total-count=\"2613\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Our marriage was unusually good, I think. Even after 20 years, my eyes lit up when my husband would walk into the room. \u201cI just love living with you,\u201d I\u2019d say. Our friend seemed happy for us.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"379\" data-total-count=\"2992\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Then my husband had a massive coronary. It was after he returned home from a ballgame. I greeted him at the door with a fresh baked treat. \u201cI made Irish soda bread muffins,\u201d I said. He enjoyed his snack and we retired for the night, ending with a sweet kiss. Twenty minutes later he screamed, \u201cSuz!\u201d Then silence.

If my husband had trouble with the lawn mower, our friend would say, \u201cI\u2019ll take a look,\u201d and after tinkering for a few minutes, the mower would be humming \u2014 put, put, put \u2014 away.If I\u2019d ordered furniture that needed assembling, he was our man. \u201cIt was supposed to be easy,\u201d I\u2019d say. He\u2019d glance at the nuts and bolts scattered on the floor and in a few minutes \u2026 viola! Everything fit perfectly. Each time, my husband and I would smile at each other sheepishly. My husband was everything to me, but he didn\u2019t have a handy bone in his body. For that matter, neither did I. Can you believe this guy? we\u2019d say to each other. He actually liked doing this stuff.We\u2019d insist on paying him for larger jobs and he charged a reasonable rate, a friend\u2019s discount you could call it. The work he did was always professional quality. When he painted, he never left a spot anywhere, except on the wall.Our friend worked on his house in summer and winter. While I\u2019d spend a free hour sitting on my porch, watching the cardinals in the bird bath, he was the kind of man who was always hammering and sawing something; he put an addition on his house all by himself.I\u2019d reciprocate; it wasn\u2019t a one-way street. When he inherited tools and needed a place to store them we offered our two-car garage and they filled it, leaving just enough room for our lawn mower. We let him store other belongings until he built his own garage, which took a year.Eventually, we struck a deal: I\u2019d cook; he\u2019d fix. We even shook hands on it. I made containers of spaghetti sauce, brisket, casseroles; now my freezer looked like the garage: overstuffed. When I\u2019d pass his way, I\u2019d take him a container or two.He was in his 50s, the same as my husband, but had two marriages behind him. Both men were nice looking, but my husband was handsome on the inside.But with our friend there were things going on that we didn\u2019t like.He had a girlfriend who visited, but there were other women, too, although his steady didn\u2019t know about them. He\u2019d keep us posted so we wouldn\u2019t say the wrong thing: \u201cThere\u2019s another girl coming this weekend,\u201d he\u2019d say. It bothered us that when the regular girlfriend visited, he let her work like a mule. She\u2019d drag out the lawn furniture and beat the carpet with a broom. \u201cThis guy\u2019s too much,\u201d my husband would say.Our marriage was unusually good, I think. Even after 20 years, my eyes lit up when my husband would walk into the room. \u201cI just love living with you,\u201d I\u2019d say. Our friend seemed happy for us.Then my husband had a massive coronary. It was after he returned home from a ballgame. I greeted him at the door with a fresh baked treat. \u201cI made Irish soda bread muffins,\u201d I said. He enjoyed his snack and we retired for the night, ending with a sweet kiss. Twenty minutes later he screamed, \u201cSuz!\u201d Then silence. There hadn\u2019t been a single sign or symptom before this.Our friend attended the funeral and did chores for me in the days that followed: turned off the water, put away the hoses and changed the filter in the heater. I was unhinged; it was all I could do to breathe, but still, I remembered to give him a container of chicken cacciatore.Two months later he and I went to a local bar for wings. We\u2019d been there before, but my husband had been with us. I couldn\u2019t eat, just sat on the bar stool and was quiet, but I noticed that he seemed to be enjoying himself. In fact, he said so. \u201cI had a good time tonight,\u201d he said. Good time? I thought. I felt like a dummy on a bar stool.Several weeks later we talked about having dinner again. I made it clear that we\u2019d be going Dutch, but he insisted on treating, which made me uneasy. When he came in the back door, he presented me with a gift bag.

The point was to make Douglass, and his many accomplishments, accord comfortably with the dictates of the day. When Hermann Goring needed to justify the service of \"The Jew Nazi\" Erhard Milch he asserted, \"I decide who is a Jew and who is Aryan.\" Goring was echoing the words of Austrian anti-Semite Karl Lueger who'd denounced Budapest as \"Judapest,\" then turned around and justified his many friendships with Jews by claiming, \"I decide who is a Jew.\"</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ad adIn-article\" id=\"adIn-article3\">\n<noscript><div><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dta-nehisi-coates%26title%3Dgermans-are-the-masters-and-poles-are-the-slaves%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=643720653&amp;tile=3\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dta-nehisi-coates%26title%3Dgermans-are-the-masters-and-poles-are-the-slaves%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=643720653&amp;tile=3\" alt=\"\"/></a></div></noscript>\n</div><p>Lueger and Goring were right. The \"Jew\" in Lueger's mind, the \"black race\" in the American mind, were little more than totems employed to legitimize injustice. Surely Jewish people (much like black people) exist in our world with their own culture and traditions. But these were not the Jews of Goring's imagination</p>\n\n<p>Likewise in Poland:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At Ciepiel\u00f3w, after a pitched battle, three hundred Polish prisoners were taken. Despite all the evidence, the German commander declared that these captured soldiers were partisans, irregular fighters unprotected by the laws of war.<strong> The Polish officers and soldiers, wearing full uniform, were astonished. The Germans made them disrobe. Now they looked more like partisans.</strong> All of them were gunned down and thrown in a ditch. In the short Polish campaign, there were at least sixty-three such actions. No fewer than three thousand Polish prisoners of war were murdered...</p>\n\n<p>As one general maintained, \u201cGermans are the masters, and Poles are the slaves.\u201d The army leadership knew that Hitler\u2019s goals for the campaign were anything but conventional. As the chief of staff summarized, it was \u201cthe intention of the Leader to destroy and exterminate the Polish people.\u201d Soldiers had been prepared to see the Polish civilian population as devious and subhuman. One of them was so convinced of Polish hostility that he interpreted a Pole\u2019s death grimace as the expression of irrational hatred of Germans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point here is invention. The reality of Polish soldiers undercut Nazi needs and so they were vanished and refashioned into \"partisans.\" One thinks of Howell Cobb writing during the Civil War, \"If slaves seem good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Or Kate Stone, after hearing of a Confederate defeat at the hands of black soldiers, writing \"there must be some mistake.\"</p>\n\n<p>In Cracow, Polish intellectual accomplishment clashed with the Nazi image of the country and so the Nazis sought turned to destruction. \"The entire professoriate of the renowned university was sent to concentration camps,\" writes Snyder. \"The statue of Adam Mickiewicz, the great romantic poet, was pulled down from its pedestal on the Market Square.\"\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In post-war Communist Poland, the art of invention continued. The country sought to purge Jews from \"public life and positions of political influence.\" There was just one problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>....who was a Jew?</p>\n\n<p>In 1968, students with Jewish names or Stalinist parents received disproportionate attention in the press. Polish authorities used anti-Semitism to separate the rest of the population from the students, organizing huge rallies of workers and soldiers. The Polish working class became, in the pronouncements of the country\u2019s leaders, the ethnically Polish working class. But matters were not so simple. The Gomu\u0142ka regime was happy to use the Jewish label to rid itself of criticism in general. A Jew, by the party definition, was not always someone whose parents were Jewish. Characteristic of the campaign was a certain vagueness about Jews: often a \u201cZionist\u201d was simply an\u00a0intellectual or someone unfavorable to the regime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I was young man, I studied history at Howard University. Much of my studies were focused on the black diaspora, and thus white racism. I wish I had understood that I was not, in fact, simply studying white racism, but the nature of power itself. I wish I had known that the rules that governed my world echoed out into the larger world. I wish I had known how unoriginal we really are.</p>\n        \n            </div>\n\n</div></body></html>", "title": "'Germans Are The Masters And Poles Are The Slaves'", "updated": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 14:28:48 GMT", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticInternational/~3/WQqLIMy33Hk/story01.htm", "_id": 86906818, "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AtlanticInternational", "text": "\"I decide who is a Jew.\" Karl Lueger, 19th century mayor of ViennaI finished Timothy Snyder's masterful study, Bloodlands, last night.

That America was full of black people, like Douglass, with white parents did nothing to dissuade. The point was to make Douglass, and his many accomplishments, accord comfortably with the dictates of the day. When Hermann Goring needed to justify the service of \"The Jew Nazi\" Erhard Milch he asserted, \"I decide who is a Jew and who is Aryan.\" Goring was echoing the words of Austrian anti-Semite Karl Lueger who'd denounced Budapest as \"Judapest,\" then turned around and justified his many friendships with Jews by claiming, \"I decide who is a Jew.\" Lueger and Goring were right. The \"Jew\" in Lueger's mind, the \"black race\" in the American mind, were little more than totems employed to legitimize injustice. Surely Jewish people (much like black people) exist in our world with their own culture and traditions. But these were not the Jews of Goring's imagination Likewise in Poland: At Ciepiel\u00f3w, after a pitched battle, three hundred Polish prisoners were taken. Despite all the evidence, the German commander declared that these captured soldiers were partisans, irregular fighters unprotected by the laws of war. The Polish officers and soldiers, wearing full uniform, were astonished. The Germans made them disrobe. Now they looked more like partisans. All of them were gunned down and thrown in a ditch. In the short Polish campaign, there were at least sixty-three such actions. No fewer than three thousand Polish prisoners of war were murdered... As one general maintained, \u201cGermans are the masters, and Poles are the slaves.\u201d The army leadership knew that Hitler\u2019s goals for the campaign were anything but conventional. As the chief of staff summarized, it was \u201cthe intention of the Leader to destroy and exterminate the Polish people.\u201d Soldiers had been prepared to see the Polish civilian population as devious and subhuman. One of them was so convinced of Polish hostility that he interpreted a Pole\u2019s death grimace as the expression of irrational hatred of Germans. The point here is invention. The reality of Polish soldiers undercut Nazi needs and so they were vanished and refashioned into \"partisans.\" One thinks of Howell Cobb writing during the Civil War, \"If slaves seem good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Or Kate Stone, after hearing of a Confederate defeat at the hands of black soldiers, writing \"there must be some mistake.\" In Cracow, Polish intellectual accomplishment clashed with the Nazi image of the country and so the Nazis sought turned to destruction. \"The entire professoriate of the renowned university was sent to concentration camps,\" writes Snyder. \"The statue of Adam Mickiewicz, the great romantic poet, was pulled down from its pedestal on the Market Square.\" In post-war Communist Poland, the art of invention continued. The country sought to purge Jews from \"public life and positions of political influence.\" There was just one problem: ....who was a Jew? In 1968, students with Jewish names or Stalinist parents received disproportionate attention in the press. Polish authorities used anti-Semitism to separate the rest of the population from the students, organizing huge rallies of workers and soldiers. The Polish working class became, in the pronouncements of the country\u2019s leaders, the ethnically Polish working class. But matters were not so simple. The Gomu\u0142ka regime was happy to use the Jewish label to rid itself of criticism in general. A Jew, by the party definition, was not always someone whose parents were Jewish. Characteristic of the campaign was a certain vagueness about Jews: often a \u201cZionist\u201d was simply an intellectual or someone unfavorable to the regime. When I was young man, I studied history at Howard University. Much of my studies were focused on the black diaspora, and thus white racism. I wish I had understood that I was not, in fact, simply studying white racism, but the nature of power itself. I wish I had known that the rules that governed my world echoed out into the larger world. I wish I had known how unoriginal we really are.", "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 14:28:48 GMT", "tags": ["International"]}, {"author": "Jo Tuckman", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"main-content-picture\" itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/14/1389723517923/Mexican-self-defence-grou-008.jpg\" alt=\"Mexican self-defence group stand guard \" itemprop=\"contentUrl representativeOfPage\" data-pin-description=\"Men belonging to a self-defence group stand guard at a checkpoint near the town of Nueva Italia, Mexico.

The home secretary, Theresa May, resisted calls last week to ban Vona from entering the country to hold the rally, which comes before elections in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Hungary\">Hungary</a> and on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day in Britain.</p><p>Demonstrators on both sides began arriving at Holborn \u2013 Jobbik's expected meeting place \u2013 at around lunchtime. They quickly blocked exits from the London Underground station, forcing most of the Jobbik supporters to stay inside.</p><p>After the Hungarian contingent retreated back down to the train platforms, most of the anti-fascist activists left, apparently believing the rally to have been cancelled. However, it went ahead with relatively little opposition further west.</p><p>Sara Liptai, a 60-year-old Hungarian who lives in the UK, protested against the rally. She said there was danger to Britain in giving a platform to the leader of a party that has previously called for a register of Jewish people who pose a \"national security risk\".</p><p>She said: \"They gain legitimacy by being able to speak freely here in a properly democratic setup. That is quite dangerous, for them to believe that it is OK.\"</p><p>Another Hungarian, Eva Keleman, who is in her 50s, said she wanted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Protest\">protest</a> against the \"gathering force and power\" of Jobbik, and other extreme-right movements. She said: \"We are protesting against all sorts of discrimination, racism and any rightwing movements.\"</p><p>Jobbik supporters said they were not authorised to speak to the press, but one \u2013 who did not give his name \u2013 said: \"There is either democracy, or there isn't.\" Vona spoke to his supporters for about 20 minutes.</p><p>The London assembly member and former Labour MP Andrew Dismore was vocal in his opposition to Vona's arrival in the UK. He wrote to the home secretary demanding that Vona be banned from holding the event.</p><p>Dismore, who as a Labour MP founded the annual memorial day, has called Jobbik \"the most powerful outwardly fascist political party in Europe\".</p><p>Speaking outside Holborn station, he said: \"I think it's very important to send the message that we won't have hatred spread on our streets of London by the Hungarian Jobbik party.</p><p>\"We have laws here against the incitement of race hatred. Jobbik party is a racist party which targets Roma, it wants to segregate them into ghettos, and it targets Jewish people.</p><p>\"This is so reminiscent in Hungary of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and it should not be allowed to continue in the UK.\"</p><p>Dismore said the home secretary had made a grave mistake by not acting on a Hope Not Hate petition with more 14,000 signatures that called for Vona to be excluded from the UK.</p><p>Unite Against Fascism's joint national secretary Sabby Dhalu said: \"Jobbik's fascist hatred has no place in a modern society here, or in the rest of Europe.

Photograph: Dan Dennison/Getty Images The leader of Europe's most powerful far-right party held a rally in London on Sunday, despite calls to ban him from the UK and strong opposition from anti-racism activists.About 100 supporters of the Hungarian Jobbik party, which has been accused of stirring up hatred of Jews and Roma, gathered at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park to hear G\u00e1bor Vona speak.The venue of the rally was changed after Jobbik supporters were confronted in central London by more than 100 members of Unite Against Fascism and other groups. The home secretary, Theresa May, resisted calls last week to ban Vona from entering the country to hold the rally, which comes before elections in Hungary and on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day in Britain.Demonstrators on both sides began arriving at Holborn \u2013 Jobbik's expected meeting place \u2013 at around lunchtime. They quickly blocked exits from the London Underground station, forcing most of the Jobbik supporters to stay inside.After the Hungarian contingent retreated back down to the train platforms, most of the anti-fascist activists left, apparently believing the rally to have been cancelled. However, it went ahead with relatively little opposition further west.Sara Liptai, a 60-year-old Hungarian who lives in the UK, protested against the rally. She said there was danger to Britain in giving a platform to the leader of a party that has previously called for a register of Jewish people who pose a \"national security risk\".She said: \"They gain legitimacy by being able to speak freely here in a properly democratic setup. That is quite dangerous, for them to believe that it is OK.\"Another Hungarian, Eva Keleman, who is in her 50s, said she wanted to protest against the \"gathering force and power\" of Jobbik, and other extreme-right movements. She said: \"We are protesting against all sorts of discrimination, racism and any rightwing movements.\"Jobbik supporters said they were not authorised to speak to the press, but one \u2013 who did not give his name \u2013 said: \"There is either democracy, or there isn't.\" Vona spoke to his supporters for about 20 minutes.The London assembly member and former Labour MP Andrew Dismore was vocal in his opposition to Vona's arrival in the UK. He wrote to the home secretary demanding that Vona be banned from holding the event.Dismore, who as a Labour MP founded the annual memorial day, has called Jobbik \"the most powerful outwardly fascist political party in Europe\".Speaking outside Holborn station, he said: \"I think it's very important to send the message that we won't have hatred spread on our streets of London by the Hungarian Jobbik party.\"We have laws here against the incitement of race hatred. Jobbik party is a racist party which targets Roma, it wants to segregate them into ghettos, and it targets Jewish people.\"This is so reminiscent in Hungary of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and it should not be allowed to continue in the UK.\"Dismore said the home secretary had made a grave mistake by not acting on a Hope Not Hate petition with more 14,000 signatures that called for Vona to be excluded from the UK.Unite Against Fascism's joint national secretary Sabby Dhalu said: \"Jobbik's fascist hatred has no place in a modern society here, or in the rest of Europe. Wherever fascists have a presence, racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks increase.\"The Metropolitan police said no arrests were made. A spokesman said: \"We assisted the group to assemble for the purpose of lawful protest.

The revolution led to a power vacuum that was quickly filled&#13;\nby the powerful and long-lived dictatorship of Fidel Castro.

Cuba's overall income and caloric consumption&#13;\nper capita today are not that much higher than they were in 1958. In 1958, Cuba&#13;\nwas <a href=\"http://www.ascecuba.org/publications/proceedings/volume19/pdfs/mesolago.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> among Latin&#13;\nAmerican nations in terms of the number&#13;\nof newspapers, TV stations, TV sets, telephones, and automobiles per capita;&#13;\ntoday, it is at the bottom.\u00a0 The&#13;\ngovernment claims that independence from Washington was a significant achievement,&#13;\nbut today the Revolution is <a href=\"http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=94444\" target=\"_blank\">embarrassingly dependent</a> on Miami, which&#13;\nin 2013 sent remittances amounting to $5.1 billion, enough to provide $1000 for&#13;\nevery Cuban worker in a country where the average annual salary is less than&#13;\n$260. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nCuba&#13;\nis a developmental anomaly. It has some of the highest numbers in average years of&#13;\nschooling in the world (as is typical&#13;\nin totalitarian states), but also has one of the lowest economic growth rates in&#13;\nthe world. It is hard to find a comparable case: typically, these higher averages go hand-in-hand with higher incomes. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMany&#13;\nblame the U.S. embargo for Cuba's economic underperformance. But the embargo&#13;\nhas always been offset by the massive subsidies that the Soviet Union provided during&#13;\nthe Cold War and that the petro-state of Venezuela has <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=345051&amp;CategoryId=10717\" target=\"_blank\">provided</a> since 2001. And&#13;\nyet, despite these direct subsidies (and Cuba's newly burgeoning trade&#13;\nrelations with countries around the world), the state is still unable to produce&#13;\nanything efficiently. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nCuba's&#13;\nonly value-added export is the talent of its people, who have been emigrating&#13;\nin droves for the past 55 years despite the lack of civil strife since the mid-1960s.&#13;\nThis year, the government liberalized exit visas (though it did not lower the&#13;\ncost of passports), leading to a 35 percent increase in departures relative to&#13;\n2012. So far, only 45 percent of those who managed to \"travel abroad\"&#13;\nhave decided to return. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMedical&#13;\ndoctors also leave in large numbers, usually as part of the state's <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec10/cuba_12-22.html\" target=\"_blank\">foreign missions</a>. But Cuban&#13;\ndoctors often take the order to go abroad happily: they seem to prefer working in&#13;\nthe slums of Venezuela, Brazil, and Haiti to the \"socialist paradise\"&#13;\nthey call home, even though they are paid only a fraction of what the Cuban&#13;\ngovernment charges for these services.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe&#13;\nCuban economy's dysfunctional nature has not escaped Ra\u00fal Castro. In fact, the&#13;\neconomy's trials have become a favorite theme in his speeches. Every time he has&#13;\na chance to talk about local conditions, Ra\u00fal <a href=\"http://laiguana.tv/noticias/2013/12/25/10591/LAS-25-VERDADES-QUE-A-UD-TODAVIA-NO-LE-HAN-CONTADO-DE-RAUL-CASTRO-SOBRE-CUBA.html\" target=\"_blank\">admonishes</a> some aspect of&#13;\nthe status quo: the \"inefficiency\" of state-owned companies, the \"laziness and proclivity&#13;\nto stealing\" of Cuban workers, the \"corruption\" of managers and bureaucrats,&#13;\nthe \"absenteeism\" of teachers, the \"complacency\" of the party's leadership,&#13;\nthe decline of \"morals\" and even \"manners\" of Cuba's youth.&#13;\nWhile Fidel Castro was the denier-in-chief,&#13;\nfamous for speeches that were groundlessly triumphalist and blind to the regime's&#13;\ncatastrophes, Ra\u00fal does nothing but complain about the system. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Whereas Fidel&#13;\nwas the Revolution's greatest propagandist, Ra\u00fal has become the Revolution's&#13;\nmost outspoken fault-finder.</span>&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nRa\u00fal&#13;\nCastro's attention to the system's flaws is no doubt a breath of fresh air for&#13;\nCubans tired of living in la-la land. It has compelled Ra\u00fal to introduce some&#13;\nof the most sweeping market-oriented reforms of the last 55 years. But the problem&#13;\nis that Cuba's president is acting both as a reformer <i>and</i> a stalwart of the long-standing&#13;\nrevolutionary regime. Ra\u00fal wants to reform <i>and</i> preserve the system, and this is&#13;\nproducing hesitant and confusing reforms.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nRa\u00fal's&#13;\ndeep roots have made him as repressive as he is open, limiting the economy and&#13;\ncurtailing private enterprise. On the one hand, Ra\u00fal has created more opportunities&#13;\nfor Cubans to become self-employed, to use remittances from exiles, and to buy&#13;\nand sell their assets such as homes and vehicles. These are huge reforms. Today,&#13;\na record number of Cubans -- 444,109, to be exact -- have obtained <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/cuba/130122/cuba-reforms-vendors-private-business-state-economy\" target=\"_blank\">self-employment</a> licenses, and a&#13;\nreal estate market is burgeoning for the first time since the revolution. From&#13;\na fiscal point of view, these economic reforms have been successful: fiscal revenues&#13;\nfrom the private sector are up by 18 percent since 2011. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut&#13;\nas is typical of old-line communists, and especially of his brother, Fidel, Ra\u00fal remains&#13;\napprehensive about the private sector. He worries that the private sector could&#13;\nbecome too large and thus able to challenge the state's stranglehold on&#13;\nsociety. Therefore, rather than boosting the private sector with further reforms,&#13;\nthe government is holding fast to restrictive policies. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nKey&#13;\nareas of the economy remain closed to competition. Self-employment is still&#13;\nbanned in most professions that require advanced skills, such as engineering, architecture,&#13;\nsoftware development, and the medical sciences. Large-scale hiring is prohibited,&#13;\nso private enterprise is limited to micro firms and family businesses. Credit&#13;\nfor the private sector is virtually non-existent. The self-employed continue to&#13;\nbe overregulated; many are closing their businesses because they cannot afford taxes or find enough <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/12/30/3844234/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban.html\" target=\"_blank\">customers</a>, since the bulk&#13;\nof the population is still employed by the state and receives meager wages. Consequently,&#13;\nthe self-employed sector remains far below the goal of 1.5 million individuals set&#13;\nby Ra\u00fal when he launched his reforms in 2011. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nRa\u00fal's&#13;\nreformer/conservative duality is equally visible in politics. He has expanded&#13;\nthe freedom of expression in a number of decrees that liberalize access to cell&#13;\nphones and the Internet -- major steps in the expansion of speech&#13;\nopportunities. Ra\u00fal has also voluntarily supported a new amendment to&#13;\nCuba's constitution that establishes a five-year term limit -- a move that is remarkable even by contemporary Latin American standards, where&#13;\npresidents are wont to <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/americas/latin-america-suffers-reelection-fever.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">relax</a> rather&#13;\nthan restrict term limits. Earlier in 2013, he said this would be his&#13;\nlast term, which means that he intends to leave office in 2018. And&#13;\ninternationally, Cuba is fully cooperating with peace talks in Colombia, a&#13;\nprocess that is vital for U.S. interests in South America.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut&#13;\nmeanwhile, Ra\u00fal has also increased Cuba's political repression. Arbitrary detentions&#13;\nhave increased from 2,074 in 2010 to more than 5,300 in 2013. The state <a href=\"http://www.unpacu.org/909-detenciones-politicas-ilegales-en-cuba-solo-en-octubre/\" target=\"_blank\">arrested</a> more than 909&#13;\nhuman rights activists in October 2013 alone. This included some members of the&#13;\nLadies in White, a peaceful, pro-human rights women's association fighting for&#13;\nthe rights of Cuban prisoners. Cuba Archive, an organization that monitors&#13;\nhuman rights, argues that under Ra\u00fal's government, the state has <a href=\"http://cubaarchive.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=95\" target=\"_blank\">overseen</a> at least 166 deaths and disappearances, all&#13;\npolitically-motivated, including the possible assassination of Cuba's most important&#13;\ncivil rights leader, Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, in 2012. Politically, therefore, Cuba is not&#13;\nmoving forward, but backwards. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMaintaining&#13;\nhis old-line roots, the Cuban president also continues to privilege the military over any&#13;\nother sector. During his tenure as minister of defense, Ra\u00fal oversaw military&#13;\noperations, and after becoming president, he accelerated Cuba's transition to&#13;\na pseudo-military regime by appointing key military officials to his cabinet,&#13;\noften to replace civilian fidelistas to consolidate the transition to his own&#13;\ngovernment. Ra\u00fal also increased the military's control of&#13;\nindustries in Cuba that engage in foreign trade. And though Ra\u00fal is critical of&#13;\nalmost every sector, he never criticizes the military. In fact, he is openly&#13;\nsupportive of it. Just this year, the government launched the construction of&#13;\nthree new \"military cities,\" state-of-the-art housing development&#13;\nprojects for members of the Armed Forces. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn&#13;\npolitical science, we are not that surprised by duality. From Russia to China&#13;\nto the Arab World, new leaders often emerge who try to act simultaneously as&#13;\nreformers and old-liners, hoping to overhaul the status quo while maintaining&#13;\nthe main elements of the existing regime. While political scientists expect one&#13;\nside to prevail, they are used to the&#13;\nidea of conflicted leaders.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut&#13;\nin Washington, this duality only worsens the divide between those who favor&#13;\nrapprochement and those who oppose it. Ra\u00fal's duality raises hope among some&#13;\ngroups who feel the time is ripe for the United States to open to Cuba, and&#13;\nvice versa. But others see Ra\u00fal the old-liner, and they become even more adamant&#13;\nabout vetoing any efforts to rebuild the ties between the two states. The&#13;\nresult is a continued impasse in U.S.-Cuba relations.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nRa\u00fal&#13;\nCastro seems to be fine with this middling approach. Just two weeks after the&#13;\nfamous controversial <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/12/opinion/navarrette-obama-raul-castro/\" target=\"_blank\">handshake</a> between Obama&#13;\nand Ra\u00fal during Nelson Mandela's funeral, Ra\u00fal gave a speech where he addressed&#13;\nU.S.-Cuban relations. Rather than take the opportunity to lambast the empire,&#13;\nas his brother would have done, Ra\u00fal stated that officials from both countries&#13;\nhave been meeting productively on immigration and other issues, proving that&#13;\nbilateral relations can be \"civilized.\" In his tone and approach,&#13;\nRa\u00fal has shown a pragmatic and even self-satisfied side.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut&#13;\nhe also said this: \"We don't demand that the United States change its&#13;\npolitical and social system, nor will we negotiate with ours.\" With this simple&#13;\nline, Ra\u00fal displayed the core of his conservatism. His duty as supreme leader&#13;\nof Cuba, he once affirmed, is to ensure the survival of the system. He won't&#13;\npay the price of better relations with the United States if that means system&#13;\nchange. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n<span class=\"pull-quote\">Ra\u00fal's&#13;\nwords were also a warning to his compatriots: namely, that his government is uninterested&#13;\nin real change.</span> For Cubans who found hope in Ra\u00fal's initial reforms, this&#13;\nstatement is hard to swallow -- not just because of its innate conservatism,&#13;\nbut because it comes from the very same man who makes, at every opportunity, the&#13;\nstrongest case for a system overhaul than any Cuban official has made in&#13;\ndecades. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nAt some point, Ra\u00fal&#13;\nCastro might find himself forced to choose between reform and tradition. While it is common for leaders to want to be&#13;\nreformers and old-liners at the same time, they eventually select one approach&#13;\nover the other. Reforms have a tendency&#13;\nto be self-generating: more freedoms lead&#13;\nto demands for more freedoms, and this in turn means a deeper overhaul of the&#13;\nsystem. Ra\u00fal will need to decide to either yield to these demands or to block them to preserve the system that he and his brothers founded 55 years ago. So far, he hasn't faced this choice. The freedom to be that ambivalent was&#13;\nprobably Ra\u00fal's biggest cause for celebration on the anniversary last week --&#13;\nbut that freedom won't last forever.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"image_credit\">ALEJANDRO ERNESTO/AFP/Getty Images</p>\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t    </div></body></html>", "title": "The Cuban Paradox - By Javier Corrales", "updated": "Mon, 06 Jan 2014 23:32:03 +0000", "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/06/the_cuban_paradox", "_id": 94245862, "source": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/node/feed", "text": "On Jan. 1, Cuba marked the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Cuban revolution, when the country's citizens rose up to topple the weak and short-lived dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.

During his tenure as minister of defense, Ra\u00fal oversaw military operations, and after becoming president, he accelerated Cuba's transition to a pseudo-military regime by appointing key military officials to his cabinet, often to replace civilian fidelistas to consolidate the transition to his own government. Ra\u00fal also increased the military's control of industries in Cuba that engage in foreign trade. And though Ra\u00fal is critical of almost every sector, he never criticizes the military. In fact, he is openly supportive of it. Just this year, the government launched the construction of three new \"military cities,\" state-of-the-art housing development projects for members of the Armed Forces. In political science, we are not that surprised by duality. From Russia to China to the Arab World, new leaders often emerge who try to act simultaneously as reformers and old-liners, hoping to overhaul the status quo while maintaining the main elements of the existing regime. While political scientists expect one side to prevail, they are used to the idea of conflicted leaders. But in Washington, this duality only worsens the divide between those who favor rapprochement and those who oppose it. Ra\u00fal's duality raises hope among some groups who feel the time is ripe for the United States to open to Cuba, and vice versa. But others see Ra\u00fal the old-liner, and they become even more adamant about vetoing any efforts to rebuild the ties between the two states. The result is a continued impasse in U.S.-Cuba relations. Ra\u00fal Castro seems to be fine with this middling approach. Just two weeks after the famous controversial handshake between Obama and Ra\u00fal during Nelson Mandela's funeral, Ra\u00fal gave a speech where he addressed U.S.-Cuban relations. Rather than take the opportunity to lambast the empire, as his brother would have done, Ra\u00fal stated that officials from both countries have been meeting productively on immigration and other issues, proving that bilateral relations can be \"civilized.\" In his tone and approach, Ra\u00fal has shown a pragmatic and even self-satisfied side. But he also said this: \"We don't demand that the United States change its political and social system, nor will we negotiate with ours.\" With this simple line, Ra\u00fal displayed the core of his conservatism. His duty as supreme leader of Cuba, he once affirmed, is to ensure the survival of the system. He won't pay the price of better relations with the United States if that means system change. Ra\u00fal's words were also a warning to his compatriots: namely, that his government is uninterested in real change. For Cubans who found hope in Ra\u00fal's initial reforms, this statement is hard to swallow -- not just because of its innate conservatism, but because it comes from the very same man who makes, at every opportunity, the strongest case for a system overhaul than any Cuban official has made in decades. At some point, Ra\u00fal Castro might find himself forced to choose between reform and tradition. While it is common for leaders to want to be reformers and old-liners at the same time, they eventually select one approach over the other. Reforms have a tendency to be self-generating: more freedoms lead to demands for more freedoms, and this in turn means a deeper overhaul of the system. Ra\u00fal will need to decide to either yield to these demands or to block them to preserve the system that he and his brothers founded 55 years ago. So far, he hasn't faced this choice. The freedom to be that ambivalent was probably Ra\u00fal's biggest cause for celebration on the anniversary last week -- but that freedom won't last forever.

There, he spent six days taking courses in computer hacking and programming at a local professional school, according to school officials and people familiar with Snowden's trip. Working with a private instructor, Snowden, who was then a contractor for the spy agency, took a course in \"ethical hacking,\" where he learned advanced techniques for breaking into computer systems and exploiting flaws in software. The class's ostensible purpose is to train students to protect computers and their contents from thieves and spies. But in order to do that, they learn how to break into computers and steal information. Snowden also inquired about methods to reverse-engineer the world's most popular kits for committing widespread online crime.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSnowden didn't disclose his India trip to investigators when renewing his top-secret security clearance the following year. It was that clearance, NSA officials say, that <a href=\"http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/17/nsa_s_top_geek_i_don_t_know_if_there_s_another_snowden#sthash.cAP3xGqh.dpbs\">gave Snowden access</a> to the 1.7 million classified files he later stole from the agency's computer networks and databases. U.S. intelligence officials have faulted the company that conducted Snowden's background check for not more thoroughly questioning him about overseas travel and what foreign nationals he may have met with, which is standard procedure for detecting whether someone is spying for a foreign power. They have characterized the background check as flawed and incomplete.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut <span class=\"fp_red\">F</span><span class=\"fp_red\">oreign Policy</span> has learned that Snowden's trip to India should not have been a mystery to the U.S. government or intelligence agencies. Snowden was in the country in his capacity as an NSA contractor \"to assist as a technical expert\" at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi, according to an individual with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified. Snowden also told his computer instructor that he worked for the NSA and that he was in the city \"on business,\" said Rohit Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of the school, <a href=\"http://www.koenig-solutions.com/\">Koenig Solutions</a>. Government employees and contractors are not required to disclose foreign trips of an official nature, and may even be instructed not to, in order to avoid compromising intelligence operations and programs, according to two former U.S. intelligence officials.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSnowden's time in India has been covered in the Indian press but has received little attention in the United States. The travels offer a rare glimpse into his activities in the years before he became arguably the most famous leaker of classified secrets in American history.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nPrecisely what work Snowden did at the embassy in New Delhi is unclear. At the time, he worked as a technology specialist for Dell Inc. at an NSA facility in Japan. U.S. intelligence personnel are often stationed in American embassies, so it's conceivable that Snowden could have been working on surveillance equipment in New Delhi. Among the documents that Snowden disclosed were those describing a program called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/australia-accused-embassies-spy-neighbours\">Stateroom</a>, which gathers electronic communications using equipment based in U.S. embassies around the world. Other documents Snowden released showed that the NSA may have spied on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/nsa-surveillance-indian-embassy-un-mission\">Indian embassy</a> in Washington and on the country's mission to the United Nations.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nCalls and emails to the U.S. embassy in New Delhi were not returned. Spokespersons for the NSA, the CIA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence all declined to comment for this article.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nAccording to officials at the Koenig school, Snowden flew to India from Japan, arriving on Sept. 2, 2010, and staying for one night at New Delhi's Hyatt Regency hotel. A Koenig representative picked him up at the hotel on Sept. 3 and then drove Snowden to a lodging facility provided by the school. He stayed there until Sept. 9 while he took classes, and then returned for one more night at the Hyatt before leaving India on Sept. 11, the school said. (Indian news publications, citing official travel and immigration <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-04/india/44756015_1_edward-snowden-information-security-koenig-solutions\">documents</a>, also show that Snowden was in the country during this period.)&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n<span class=\"pull-quote\">Snowden's instructor said he made no secret about his work for the NSA.</span> While he didn't describe the specific purpose of his visit, he did say he wanted to squeeze in some computer coursework while he was in town. The U.S. embassy is only six miles from the Koenig school. Snowden paid the $2,000 tuition and lodging fee himself, using a personal credit card, Aggarwal said.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSnowden's instructor described him as quiet and diligent. He didn't take many breaks. And he already had a high-level of knowledge about computer science, hacking, and programming.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nHad background investigators inquired about Snowden's travels, they likely would have asked if he'd had any contact with foreign nationals while he was abroad. All security clearance holders are required to disclose significant contact with foreigners. But any instructors and students Snowden met probably wouldn't have risen to that level, a former intelligence official said. A Koenig spokesman said the school could only vouch for Snowden's whereabouts while he was taking courses during the day. \"Other than our people and students we would have no idea whom he met,\" said the spokesman, Somit Biswas.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn addition to the ethical hacking course, Snowden took a class in the Java computer programming language. Snowden said the course \"would help him in 'organizing a team who does' work on Java\" at Dell, a Koenig spokesperson said, citing a questionnaire that Snowden was required to fill out before he came to the school.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\"His stated goal for coming to train at Koenig ... was 'getting knowledge and evaluating Koenig's training program for my company. Certification might be nice, but it is not necessary,'\" Biswas said. \"He had also stated that his employers had approved Koenig as a training provider and that he would also be writing a review of the training experience which would help his company to evaluate Koenig as a future training partner and might be mutually beneficial to both.\"&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nDavid Frink, a spokesperson for Dell, declined to comment. \"We have not discussed Mr. Snowden's role with Dell and don't plan to,\" he said. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported last year that Snowden's \"work supervisor\" <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324906304579039381125706104\">informed</a> investigators performing his background check that he had gone to India, but that they failed to clarify the purpose of the trip, resulting in a report that \"did not present a comprehensive picture of Mr. Snowden,\" according to an intelligence documents.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBiswas said Snowden also inquired about courses in the analysis and reverse engineering of malicious computer code, such as the the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/zeus/\">ZeuS</a>, Fragus, and SpyEye crimeware kits. That was a curious request, and potentially at odds with his interest in ethical hacking. Understanding malware is important for defending against it. But these are not ordinary malware. ZeuS is the world's premier <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/st_crimeware/\">toolbox for custom-building online crime campaigns.</a> It has been used to infect millions of computers around the world. All three programs have been used by criminals to commandeer individuals' computers and to steal financial information. SpyEye allows criminals to create fake bank web pages, in order to trick people into entering their login and password, which the criminal then steals and uses to enter, and empty, their accounts. Last year, Microsoft filed a <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/spyeye-zeus-botmaster-indicted/\">civil complaint</a> alleging that clusters of computers infected with ZeuS have been used to steal more than $100 million.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIt's not clear why Snowden wanted to know about reverse engineering financial crime malware, but his resume indicates he may have been working on cyber security-related projects while a contractor with Dell. Koenig told Snowden that it didn't offer courses along the lines he was interested in, but that it was considering adding them to its curriculum.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSnowden abruptly ended his coursework before completing a final portion of his training, Aggarwal said, in computer hacking forensics and an administrator course in the Linux operating system. \"He was supposed to come back one morning, but he didn't. He sent an email saying, please cancel the rest of my courses. I have a medical condition and need to go back to Japan for medical advice,\" according to Aggarwal. Snowden spent the night of September 10 at the Hyatt Regency, and then left India the next day, he said.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSnowden completed the ethical hacking course and the course in Java programming, Aggarwal said. A source who is familiar with Snowden's professional resume, which was current as of 2013, said it lists his certification in ethical hacking as well as computer network defense. The only reference to even remotely anything like Java, this person said, appears in relation to Snowden's work for a website company called Clockwork Chihuahua. There, Snowden said he edited JavaScript (which is loosely related to, but is not the same as Java). Snowden also claimed to have Japanese language skills and to be \"comfortable working in austere environments,\" according to his resume.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nU.S. officials have said that Snowden <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/15/usa-security-snowden-dell-idUSL2N0GF11220130815\">began downloading</a> secret NSA files while he was working for Dell, in April 2012. He went to work for another NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, the following year.

He is currently living in Russia, where the government has granted him temporary asylum.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nA computer security training professional in the United States said it's not unusual for Americans to take courses abroad, particularly in India, where the tuition is a fraction of what it can cost in the United States.

Aggarwal, the Koening CEO, said it's not unusual to find U.S. intelligence employees taking courses at his school, and that between 50 and 100 American military service personnel take courses there each year, as well as at a location in Dubai. A Defense Department spokesman could not confirm that military personnel have taken courses at the school, or that it's been approved by the Pentagon as a training facility. But personnel responsible for protecting the department's computer systems are required to obtain commercial certificaitons, including in ethical hacking.

Their position subsequently changed, but a group of Conservative MPs - some on the right of the party - believe that \"grudging support\" for the measure doesn't strike the right tone for a party which claims to be on the side of hard working families. Some are urging the prime minister to make a speech setting out why his party had been wrong not to introduce it themselves in order to \"kill off a negative\". They see parallels with David Cameron's backing for the NHS, another Labour creation, before the last election. The then opposition leader stated he could sum up his political priorities in three letters - N.H.S - and then attempted to steal a march on Labour by pledging to increase the health budget. Past errors These Conservative backbenchers want to see a similar approach to helping the low paid - a \"clear the way\" speech recognising past errors, followed by an above-inflation increase in minimum wage rates. And now more influential figures are making their voices heard. Sources close to the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggest he is in favour of a significant increase - partly because, with the chancellor keen to make further welfare savings, the higher the minimum wage then the lower the expenditure on tax credits to top up low incomes. The business minister Matt Hancock - a former adviser to George Osborne - previously agreed to an increase in the lower apprentice rate, and is likely to favour an across the board increase now. Another minister close to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, told the BBC on Wednesday that the minimum wage \"is about 10% lower in real terms, I think, than where it was in 2008\" and there was a \"a strong case to look at it\". And indeed it is already being examined. Review Last September, the business secretary Vince Cable asked the Low Pay Commission - which recommends minimum wage rates - to look at what economic conditions would be needed for a higher than usual rise. The Commission will report to him - and to David Cameron and Nick Clegg - by the end of next month. It is well known that Mr Cable wants to see the minimum wage rise as the economy recovers. However, sources close to the business secretary are making it clear that he has no intention of agreeing to a pre-election inflation-busting boost, unless specifically recommended by the experts, and not simply by fellow politicians. He is far more likely to accept whatever the Commission recommends and doesn't believe the Chancellor will try to over-rule him. That's not to say that the Conservatives couldn't pledge a much bigger increase in their next manifesto. Political ground But the Lib Dems see the current debate amongst their coalition partners as an attempt to move on to their ground, having alienated more moderate support over Europe and immigration, and aren't minded to help them out just yet. But some Conservatives say there is a way of appealing to those on low incomes without over-ruling the Low Pay Commission if it opts for a modest rise this year. These MPs are pressing the Treasury to look at the net - rather than gross pay - of those on the minimum wage. From April the first \u00a310,000 of income will be tax free but workers begin paying national insurance - which to many, feels like a tax - at the lower income of \u00a37,775. By raising the national insurance threshold to \u00a310,000 too by the time of the election the Conservatives would be able to say that all those on the minimum wage were better off. That of course would cost, not save, money. 'Top-up' But there are calls, too, for a minimum wage \"top up\" in areas of high costs and higher average earnings paid for by employers, not government. Labour politicians have also talked of backing a significant rise in the minimum wage, but without specific figures and having a higher \"minimum\" in some sectors of the economy. But their main thrust is likely to be on pressing companies to pay a higher \"living wage\" - currently \u00a37.65 an hour, rather than the minimum adult hourly rate of \u00a36.31. A future Labour government would be likely to insist that private employers which benefit from public sector contracts pay their employees this higher figure, or above. Some Conservative strategists believe Labour would be on the back foot if the current government backed a significant increase for the low-paid. For their part, Labour strategists believe the debate demonstrates that David Cameron is being forced to fight on their territory - that is, he's battling over the cost of living and not the improving state of the economy.", "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2014 21:57:32 GMT", "tags": null}, {"author": "Reena Flores", "html": "<html><body><div><section id=\"articleBody\">&#13;\n\t<p>&#13;\n\t\tGovernor Chris Christie is <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/chris-christie-i-am-embarrassed-and-humiliated-20140109\" target=\"_blank\">embarrassed and humiliated</a> by his administration's George Washington Bridge scandal.

(Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)</figcaption></figure><p>The idea for the Free Syrian University took root one year ago among several former classmates who attended Damascus University with al-Jamal in the 1970s and fled Syria for Turkey at the outbreak of violence. These include Ibrahimi al-Haji<strong>,</strong> who for 18 years was the chief justice in a court in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, and who now functions as the university\u2019s legal advisor. Support has also come from professors among the Syrian diaspora living in Europe, who have offered to teach classes both in Turkey and from afar via the Internet, primarily through Facebook and Skype.</p>\n\n<p>The curriculum, al-Jamal says, is \u201ca combination of the old regime curriculum and new information from Sweden and Germany in particular. For example, we are adding English to each student\u2019s courses each semester, so that all of our graduates can easily find work.\u201d University officials are offering students 13 majors, including political science, law, media, education, psychology, economics, business, Arabic literature, and pharmacology. Perhaps with a nod to the university\u2019s location, the institution will also offer degrees in Turkish and English translation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have 32 professors ready here in Reyhanli and more than 60 around the world who are helping,\u201d says a young female lawyer from Damascus who is working at the university and who asked to remain anonymous because her family is still in Syria. \u201cAll are Syrian.\u201d</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\"><p>\u201cThere is no more education in Syria,\u201d Ismail says. \u201cIt\u2019s all for show, whatever is left.\u201d</p>\n</aside><p>For young Syrian refugees like Ismail who are in Turkey, classes are taught in a three-story office building in Reyhanli. But al-Jamal is intent on also providing educational opportunities to students trapped or displaced inside Syria. To that end, through what he terms an \u201copen-learning\u201d approach, the Syrian academic is making heavy use of the Internet, including social networks like Facebook, to deliver lessons to students still in Syria. Syrian professors in Turkey and around the world are working to record lessons relevant to the set curriculum and post them online. University staff then distribute these lessons to a growing mailing list divided by major. \u201cThis is temporary, to immediately address this reality,\u201d al-Jamal says. The school sends most of its news out via its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Free.Syrian.university\">Facebook page</a>, which more than 6,000 people follow.</p>\n\n<p>The Free Syrian University has formally enrolled 870 students in Turkey and has hundreds more on digital mailing lists inside Syria and other neighboring countries, mainly in Jordan. \u201cThe enrollment looks great,\u201d al-Jamal says. He estimates that enrollment could reach as high as 11,500 in just a few years if the conflict continues, mainly because there are so few options for Syrians seeking an advanced degree, and because students may eventually come from Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon to study.</p>\n\n<p>A modest fee structure is in place, though more than 90 percent of students are unable to pay anything and attend classes for free. \u201cWe charge $280 per semester to those students inside Syria, and $560 per semester to those students outside,\u201d says al-Jamal. \u201cWe would prefer to charge nothing, but supplies are expensive and our teaching staff have families who need their support. This income just covers our costs.\u201d The university will admit any Syrian who was a student prior to the fighting as well as those who would have been scheduled to attend college.</p>\n\n<p>Al-Jamal repeatedly stresses that no one has supported the venture financially, and that all costs are paid out of pocket, many by the university professors themselves. \u201cWe give new professors $1,500 when they sign up. Total. That\u2019s all we can give them,\u201d he notes, adding that he hopes others will see the importance of supporting Syria\u2019s future leaders. The university\u2019s stated goal is \u201cto prepare educated generations who seek to build a country of law and justice and institutions.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/FSU_President_4/1422892ec.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Mosab al-Jamal at his office in Reyhanli.\u00a0(Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)</figcaption></figure><p>Though there is no outright political agenda in classrooms and operations are largely funded by professors themselves, the university\u2014with both its name and its mandate from the Free Syrian Legal Authority, a type of clearinghouse organization that proves the organization functions with the blessing of the Free Syrian Army\u2014is directly connected to the armed resistance against the Assad regime.

These include Ibrahimi al-Haji, who for 18 years was the chief justice in a court in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, and who now functions as the university\u2019s legal advisor. Support has also come from professors among the Syrian diaspora living in Europe, who have offered to teach classes both in Turkey and from afar via the Internet, primarily through Facebook and Skype. The curriculum, al-Jamal says, is \u201ca combination of the old regime curriculum and new information from Sweden and Germany in particular. For example, we are adding English to each student\u2019s courses each semester, so that all of our graduates can easily find work.\u201d University officials are offering students 13 majors, including political science, law, media, education, psychology, economics, business, Arabic literature, and pharmacology. Perhaps with a nod to the university\u2019s location, the institution will also offer degrees in Turkish and English translation. \u201cWe have 32 professors ready here in Reyhanli and more than 60 around the world who are helping,\u201d says a young female lawyer from Damascus who is working at the university and who asked to remain anonymous because her family is still in Syria. \u201cAll are Syrian.\u201d \u201cThere is no more education in Syria,\u201d Ismail says. \u201cIt\u2019s all for show, whatever is left.\u201d For young Syrian refugees like Ismail who are in Turkey, classes are taught in a three-story office building in Reyhanli. But al-Jamal is intent on also providing educational opportunities to students trapped or displaced inside Syria. To that end, through what he terms an \u201copen-learning\u201d approach, the Syrian academic is making heavy use of the Internet, including social networks like Facebook, to deliver lessons to students still in Syria. Syrian professors in Turkey and around the world are working to record lessons relevant to the set curriculum and post them online. University staff then distribute these lessons to a growing mailing list divided by major. \u201cThis is temporary, to immediately address this reality,\u201d al-Jamal says. The school sends most of its news out via its Facebook page, which more than 6,000 people follow. The Free Syrian University has formally enrolled 870 students in Turkey and has hundreds more on digital mailing lists inside Syria and other neighboring countries, mainly in Jordan. \u201cThe enrollment looks great,\u201d al-Jamal says. He estimates that enrollment could reach as high as 11,500 in just a few years if the conflict continues, mainly because there are so few options for Syrians seeking an advanced degree, and because students may eventually come from Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon to study. A modest fee structure is in place, though more than 90 percent of students are unable to pay anything and attend classes for free. \u201cWe charge $280 per semester to those students inside Syria, and $560 per semester to those students outside,\u201d says al-Jamal. \u201cWe would prefer to charge nothing, but supplies are expensive and our teaching staff have families who need their support. This income just covers our costs.\u201d The university will admit any Syrian who was a student prior to the fighting as well as those who would have been scheduled to attend college. Al-Jamal repeatedly stresses that no one has supported the venture financially, and that all costs are paid out of pocket, many by the university professors themselves. \u201cWe give new professors $1,500 when they sign up. Total. That\u2019s all we can give them,\u201d he notes, adding that he hopes others will see the importance of supporting Syria\u2019s future leaders. The university\u2019s stated goal is \u201cto prepare educated generations who seek to build a country of law and justice and institutions.\u201d Mosab al-Jamal at his office in Reyhanli. (Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)Though there is no outright political agenda in classrooms and operations are largely funded by professors themselves, the university\u2014with both its name and its mandate from the Free Syrian Legal Authority, a type of clearinghouse organization that proves the organization functions with the blessing of the Free Syrian Army\u2014is directly connected to the armed resistance against the Assad regime. Depending on the outcome of the war, this could prove problematic for graduates as well as university officials should they seek accreditation or re-enter Syria. When we interviewed al-Jamal, this connection was personified by a quiet, chain-smoking man in a leather jacket who was introduced only as \u201cthe colonel\u201d and who was never out of earshot during our conversation. He interrupted only when talk turned to the nature of the conflict in Syria. \u201cThis is a revolution, nothing else,\u201d he said sharply when the wrong vernacular was used. He is certain the Assad regime will fall \u201cany day now.\u201d For now, the Free Syrian University\u2019s bespectacled academics know there is no going back to Syria. \u201cI burned my life in Syria when I left,\u201d says al-Jamal, eliciting nods of agreement from Syrian academics around him. \u201cIt was the suppression of the educated. It was the suppression of the arts. And the suppression of all those outside of the regime over the last decades\u2014that is our reason for being a part of this.\u201d \u201cWe have these new ideas,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat is why we started this.\u201d", "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 21:56:49 GMT", "tags": ["International"]}, {"author": "By EDWARD WONG", "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w480\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/10/world/10sino-guagua01/10sino-guagua01-blog480.jpg\" id=\"100000002642563\" alt=\"Bo Guagua, left, with his father, Bo Xilai, in 2007.\"/><span class=\"credit\">Reuters</span> <span class=\"caption\">Bo Guagua, left, with his father, Bo Xilai, in 2007.</span></div>\n<p>Ever\u00a0since\u00a0Bo\u00a0Xilai,\u00a0the\u00a0Communist\u00a0Party\u00a0aristocrat,\u00a0was\u00a0given\u00a0a sentence\u00a0of life in prison last\u00a0September\u00a0on\u00a0charges\u00a0of\u00a0corruption,\u00a0very\u00a0little\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0way\u00a0of  new\u00a0details\u00a0about\u00a0his\u00a0downfall\u00a0have\u00a0emerged.\u00a0But\u00a0this week,\u00a0a\u00a0Chinese magazine,\u00a0Sanlian\u00a0Life,\u00a0published\u00a0a\u00a031\u00ad-page\u00a0cover\u00a0story\u00a0on\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Bo\u2019s youngest\u00a0son,\u00a0Bo\u00a0Guagua,\u00a0a\u00a0favorite\u00a0focus\u00a0of\u00a0gossip\u00a0in\u00a0China.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0currently a first-year student at Columbia\u00a0Law\u00a0School\u00a0and\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0spotted\u00a0at\u00a0social gatherings\u00a0in\u00a0Manhattan.</p>\n<p>The reporter, Li Jing, had spoken to some family friends, but the story was less an expos\u00e9 than a summary of the reams of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/world/asia/leaders-fall-in-china-put-allies-in-peril.html\">reporting</a> last year by a galaxy of news organizations on the Bo family murder\u00ad scandal.</p>\n<div class=\"w190 right\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/10/world/10sino-guagua02/10sino-guagua02-articleInline.jpg\" id=\"100000002642567\" alt=\"Wang Lijin, in 2008.\"/><span class=\"credit\">Chinatopix, via Associated Press</span> <span class=\"caption\">Wang Lijin, in 2008.</span></div>\n<p>One detail did jump out.

Ever since Bo Xilai, the Communist Party aristocrat, was given a sentence of life in prison last September on charges of corruption, very little in the way of new details about his downfall have emerged. But this week, a Chinese magazine, Sanlian Life, published a 31\u00ad-page cover story on Mr. Bo\u2019s youngest son, Bo Guagua, a favorite focus of gossip in China. He is currently a first-year student at Columbia Law School and has been spotted at social gatherings in Manhattan. The reporter, Li Jing, had spoken to some family friends, but the story was less an expos\u00e9 than a summary of the reams of reporting last year by a galaxy of news organizations on the Bo family murder\u00ad scandal. Chinatopix, via Associated Press Wang Lijin, in 2008. One detail did jump out. The article said that after Wang Lijun, the former Chongqing police chief, fled to the United States Consulate in the city of Chengdu on Feb. 6, 2012, a prominent Australian reporter based in Beijing for the Sydney Morning Herald, John Garnaut, was called in to act as his interpreter. Mr. Wang then proceeded to tell American officials gathered in the consulate library his suspicions of how Mr. Bo\u2019s wife, Gu Kailai, had murdered a British businessman, Neil Heywood. The story about Mr. Garnaut was surprising. From the way the article was written, it sounded like he had told this to Ms. Li. In China circles, Mr. Garnaut is known for his deep reporting on elite party politics. In this case, had he transcended the role of observer and somehow become a participant, and then kept that secret this entire time? This was hard to believe. Friends of Mr. Garnaut did not recall him mentioning playing such a role. Western officials who discussed with this reporter what had transpired in the consulate had not talked about Mr. Garnaut acting as interpreter. Any mention of such an encounter was absent too from Mr. Garnaut\u2019s recent book on the Bo family and from a detailed article he wrote in September 2012 on Mr. Wang\u2019s 30\u00ad-plus hours in the consulate. Around the same time, Jeremy Page, the Wall Street Journal correspondent who had broken compelling stories on Mr. Bo\u2019s downfall, had also written a comprehensive account of Mr. Wang\u2019s consulate flight, and Mr. Garnaut was absent too from that narrative. Soon after Mr. Wang entered the consulate, Mr. Bo dispatched scores of police vehicles from Chongqing to surround the American building and try to retrieve Mr. Wang. The authorities in Sichuan Province had also surrounded the building with their own forces. All that had built into a tense three\u00ad-way standoff involving the American guards at the consulate gate. How would Mr. Garnaut have gotten inside? Still, unlikelier events had taken place during the Bo saga. And Mr. Garnaut\u2019s father, Ross Garnaut, had once been Australia\u2019s ambassador to China. Perhaps, far\u00adfetched as it might sound, those diplomatic ties had come into play during the Wang Lijun episode. So Thursday night, the younger Mr. Garnaut, who had moved back to Australia last year, was asked in an email about the Sanlian Life report. \u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t seen it, and very much look forward to seeing what they say on young GG,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cMy own cameo, well, that\u2019s fantastic.To be the central player in the biggest China story of the decade and not even remember it.\u201d He said Michael Anti, the prominent Chinese blogger (real name: Zhao Jing), had made the same claim in an article in January 2013 for Southern Metropolis Weekly. As soon as that article appeared, Mr. Garnaut had contacted Mr. Anti to tell him about the error, and Mr. Anti issued a correction to the story, which was about foreign correspondents, on both Twitter and his Chinese microblog. Editors corrected the official version that appears on Southern Metropolis Weekly\u2019s website. The original version can still be found on the Internet, though. Mr. Anti did not reply to emails or a phone text asking where he had originally heard the rumor. In his Chinese microblog post on Jan. 30, 2013, he said he would in the future avoid relying on Chinese-language sources for reports on foreigners. \u201cShame on me,\u201d he wrote in English. And he said he would invite Mr. Garnaut to coffee. Ms. Li, the reporter for Sanlian Life, declined to comment. Journalists with knowledge of the 31\u00ad-page article said it had been in the works for a long time. One journalist said the detail about Mr. Garnaut probably came from a Chinese\u00ad-language source. Meanwhile, many China watchers have been talking with anticipation about Mr. Garnaut\u2019s next book.

Ever since Bo Xilai, the Communist Party aristocrat, was given a sentence of life in prison last September on charges of corruption, very little in the way of new details about his downfall have emerged. But this week, a Chinese magazine, Sanlian Life, published a 31\u00ad-page cover story on Mr. Bo\u2019s youngest son, Bo Guagua, a favorite focus of gossip in China. He is currently a first-year student at Columbia Law School and has been spotted at social gatherings in Manhattan. The reporter, Li Jing, had spoken to some family friends, but the story was less an expos\u00e9 than a summary of the reams of reporting last year by a galaxy of news organizations on the Bo family murder\u00ad scandal. Chinatopix, via Associated Press Wang Lijin, in 2008. One detail did jump out. The article said that after Wang Lijun, the former Chongqing police chief, fled to the United States Consulate in the city of Chengdu on Feb. 6, 2012, a prominent Australian reporter based in Beijing for the Sydney Morning Herald, John Garnaut, was called in to act as his interpreter. Mr. Wang then proceeded to tell American officials gathered in the consulate library his suspicions of how Mr. Bo\u2019s wife, Gu Kailai, had murdered a British businessman, Neil Heywood. The story about Mr. Garnaut was surprising. From the way the article was written, it sounded like he had told this to Ms. Li. In China circles, Mr. Garnaut is known for his deep reporting on elite party politics. In this case, had he transcended the role of observer and somehow become a participant, and then kept that secret this entire time? This was hard to believe. Friends of Mr. Garnaut did not recall him mentioning playing such a role. Western officials who discussed with this reporter what had transpired in the consulate had not talked about Mr. Garnaut acting as interpreter. Any mention of such an encounter was absent too from Mr. Garnaut\u2019s recent book on the Bo family and from a detailed article he wrote in September 2012 on Mr. Wang\u2019s 30\u00ad-plus hours in the consulate. Around the same time, Jeremy Page, the Wall Street Journal correspondent who had broken compelling stories on Mr. Bo\u2019s downfall, had also written a comprehensive account of Mr. Wang\u2019s consulate flight, and Mr. Garnaut was absent too from that narrative. Soon after Mr. Wang entered the consulate, Mr. Bo dispatched scores of police vehicles from Chongqing to surround the American building and try to retrieve Mr. Wang. The authorities in Sichuan Province had also surrounded the building with their own forces. All that had built into a tense three\u00ad-way standoff involving the American guards at the consulate gate. How would Mr. Garnaut have gotten inside? Still, unlikelier events had taken place during the Bo saga. And Mr. Garnaut\u2019s father, Ross Garnaut, had once been Australia\u2019s ambassador to China. Perhaps, far\u00adfetched as it might sound, those diplomatic ties had come into play during the Wang Lijun episode. So Thursday night, the younger Mr. Garnaut, who had moved back to Australia last year, was asked in an email about the Sanlian Life report. \u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t seen it, and very much look forward to seeing what they say on young GG,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cMy own cameo, well, that\u2019s fantastic.To be the central player in the biggest China story of the decade and not even remember it.\u201d He said Michael Anti, the prominent Chinese blogger (real name: Zhao Jing), had made the same claim in an article in January 2013 for Southern Metropolis Weekly. As soon as that article appeared, Mr. Garnaut had contacted Mr. Anti to tell him about the error, and Mr. Anti issued a correction to the story, which was about foreign correspondents, on both Twitter and his Chinese microblog. Editors corrected the official version that appears on Southern Metropolis Weekly\u2019s website. The original version can still be found on the Internet, though. Mr. Anti said in a phone text message late Friday night that he had first read the \u201cmistaken account\u201d on an overseas Chinese website, but could not remember which one. In his Chinese microblog post on Jan. 30, 2013, he said he would in the future avoid relying on Chinese-language sources for reports on foreigners. \u201cShame on me,\u201d he wrote in English. And he said he would invite Mr. Garnaut to coffee. Ms. Li, the reporter for Sanlian Life, declined to comment. Journalists with knowledge of the 31\u00ad-page article said it had been in the works for a long time. One journalist said the detail about Mr. Garnaut probably came from a Chinese\u00ad-language source. Meanwhile, many China watchers have been talking with anticipation about Mr. Garnaut\u2019s next book. It is on \u201cprincelings,\u201d those Chinese who, like Bo Xilai and Bo Guagua, are members of the party\u2019s revered revolutionary families. The book will no doubt have many interesting tales of China\u2019s so\u00ad-called red nobility, and Mr. Garnaut has been working hard to separate fact from fiction.

COLUMBIA, Md. \u2014 Shots rang out at a popular shopping mall in this suburb between Washington and Baltimore on Saturday morning, sending shoppers running from stores and hiding under tables in the food court. When police officers arrived, they found three people dead inside a skate shop on the upper level of the two-story center, the Mall in Columbia. Two of the victims were a young man and woman who worked at the store.

Ms. Carrillo begins the conversation nervously by asking what steps Ms. Cardosa, now a vice principal, takes when a student reports a sexual relationship with a teacher. The vice principal responds that she involves law enforcement officials. Then Ms. Carrillo asks the vice principal why she is above the law. \u201cWhy did you do that?

Under his stewardship, the network, known best for its conservative opinion shows in prime time, dominates the cable news competition, frequently posting ratings better than those for its main rivals, MSNBC and CNN, combined. It has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox, its parent, with annual earnings that have been estimated at $1 billion.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe book describes in detail Mr. Ailes\u2019s professional ambition, his desire to influence American politics through a conservative prism, and his status as a visionary who possessed an intuitive understanding of the power of television to shape public opinion. Before entering the corporate world, Mr. Ailes was a political consultant, and Mr. Sherman\u2019s book credits him with being a pioneer in using television during election campaigns.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nIn the months before publication, the book has drawn sharp criticism from a chorus of people connected to Fox News, including employees and contributors who have taken to Twitter to attack Mr. Sherman.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nMr. Ailes, in what some viewed as an attempt to pre-empt Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, cooperated with another biography, \u201c<a title=\"Times review.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/books/roger-ailes-off-camera-by-zev-chafets.html\">Roger Ailes: Off Camera</a>\u201d by Zev Chafets, which was published last year by Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nIn his book, Mr. Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine, follows Mr. Ailes, 73, from his boyhood in Ohio to his perch as one of the most powerful figures in the history of television.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nDespite being unsatisfied with many of the Republican candidates for president in 2012, Mr. Ailes endeavored to promote Mitt Romney on Fox News programs, the book says. Before the Wisconsin congressman Paul D.

In \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d Mr. Sherman writes that the video \u201cwas Ailes\u2019s brainchild.\u201d        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe New York Times obtained a copy of the book in advance of its publication.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nMr. Sherman said in the source notes that he interviewed 614 people who knew or worked with Mr. Ailes for the book, which took more than three years to report and write. More than 100 pages are devoted to source notes and bibliography.        </p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nFormer employees cited in the book talked of Mr. Ailes\u2019s volatile temper and domineering behavior.

Nephi Niven Gabriel Sherman, a New York magazine contributing editor, says he interviewed 614 people for his book. In the corporate thicket of News Corporation, according to a new book, Mr. Ailes dared to battle with Lachlan Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman, openly gloating when the younger Mr. Murdoch eventually left his post at the company and even commandeering his chair. At Fox News, the book says, Mr. Ailes was disdainful of even his most bankable on-air talent, privately calling Bill O\u2019Reilly \u201ca book salesman with a TV show\u201d and Brian Kilmeade, a peppy Fox host, \u201ca soccer coach from Long Island.\u201d Those episodes are described in \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room\u201d by Gabriel Sherman, a 560-page biography of Mr. Ailes being published on Jan. 21 by Random House. The book aims to be an exhaustive look at Mr. Ailes\u2019s life and his monumental career, particularly as chairman of Fox News Channel. Under his stewardship, the network, known best for its conservative opinion shows in prime time, dominates the cable news competition, frequently posting ratings better than those for its main rivals, MSNBC and CNN, combined. It has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox, its parent, with annual earnings that have been estimated at $1 billion. The book describes in detail Mr. Ailes\u2019s professional ambition, his desire to influence American politics through a conservative prism, and his status as a visionary who possessed an intuitive understanding of the power of television to shape public opinion. Before entering the corporate world, Mr. Ailes was a political consultant, and Mr. Sherman\u2019s book credits him with being a pioneer in using television during election campaigns. In the months before publication, the book has drawn sharp criticism from a chorus of people connected to Fox News, including employees and contributors who have taken to Twitter to attack Mr. Sherman. Mr. Ailes, in what some viewed as an attempt to pre-empt Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, cooperated with another biography, \u201cRoger Ailes: Off Camera\u201d by Zev Chafets, which was published last year by Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin. In his book, Mr. Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine, follows Mr. Ailes, 73, from his boyhood in Ohio to his perch as one of the most powerful figures in the history of television. Despite being unsatisfied with many of the Republican candidates for president in 2012, Mr. Ailes endeavored to promote Mitt Romney on Fox News programs, the book says. Before the Wisconsin congressman Paul D. Ryan was chosen as Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate, Mr. Ailes advised Mr. Ryan that his television skills needed work and recommended a speech coach. At the beginning of the general election, a four-minute video criticizing President Obama\u2019s policies was broadcast on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d provoking outrage from the left and prompting the network to say publicly that Mr. Ailes had no involvement in its creation. In \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d Mr. Sherman writes that the video \u201cwas Ailes\u2019s brainchild.\u201d The New York Times obtained a copy of the book in advance of its publication. Mr. Sherman said in the source notes that he interviewed 614 people who knew or worked with Mr. Ailes for the book, which took more than three years to report and write. More than 100 pages are devoted to source notes and bibliography. Former employees cited in the book talked of Mr. Ailes\u2019s volatile temper and domineering behavior. In one anecdote, a television producer, Randi Harrison, told Mr. Sherman that while negotiating her salary with Mr. Ailes at NBC in the 1980s, he offered her an additional $100 each week \u201cif you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.\u201d A Fox News spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cThese charges are false.

While we have not read the book, the only reality here is that Gabe was not provided any direct access to Roger Ailes and the book was never fact-checked with Fox News.\u201d Gabriel Sherman, a New York magazine contributing editor, says he interviewed 614 people for his book. Nephi Niven The book also describes an explosive episode dating back to 1995, when Mr. Ailes was a high-ranking executive at NBC and locked in a power struggle with another executive, David Zaslav.At a company dinner, according to the book, Mr. Ailes made clear he was ready to do battle with Mr. Zaslav. \u201cLet\u2019s kill the S.O.B.,\u201d he told his dining companions, Mr. Sherman writes. At a separate meeting with Mr. Zaslav, the book says, Mr. Ailes was said to have unleashed a vulgar, anti-Semitic slur at his rival.That episode was promptly investigated, at NBC\u2019s behest, by a partner from the firm Proskauer Rose, Mr. Sherman writes. The partner concluded in his internal report that he believed the allegation that Mr. Ailes made an anti-Semitic remark \u2014 an obscene phrase with the words \u201clittle\u201d and \u201cJew\u201d \u2014 was true. Bob Wright, the former chairman and chief executive of NBC who was Mr. Ailes\u2019s boss at the time, is quoted in the book as saying, \u201cMy conclusion was that he probably said it.\u201d Mr. Sherman also cites documentation from the investigation.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Ailes specifically denied using an anti-Semitic slur against Mr. Zaslav.Mr. Zaslav, now the chief executive of Discovery and one of the most powerful executives in television, also denied it. \u201cWe fought with each other and we fought with a lot of other people,\u201d he said Tuesday in a phone interview. \u201cBut this allegation is false.\u201d He added that he and Mr. Ailes were now friends.In his source notes, Mr. Sherman quotes Mr. Zaslav as denying the episode.Random House, which acquired \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room\u201d in December 2010, said that Mr. Sherman was prepared to speak up in the news media to defend the book. An excerpt will run in New York magazine.Both Mr. Sherman and Random House say they are girding for a counterattack from Fox News. Some Fox employees have already denigrated Mr. Sherman publicly, with the prime-time host Sean Hannity calling him a \u201cphony journalist\u201d on Twitter.Last year, lawyers from Fox News met with lawyers from Random House to discuss Mr. Sherman\u2019s book. Fox requested the meeting because it had heard about allegations that might be in the book that it said were inaccurate, and to emphasize that the book had not been fact-checked by Fox News.Theresa Zoro, a spokeswoman for Random House, said in a statement that Mr. Sherman\u2019s book was \u201can objective and rigorously reported account of Roger Ailes\u2019s life and his running of Fox News. We fully stand by the book. If anyone has issues with it, we will respond with the facts as Gabe Sherman has reported them.\u201dMr. Sherman said in an email: \u201cI consider Roger Ailes to be one of the most fascinating, consequential figures in contemporary American life. I wrote this book to shed light on the full scope of his talents and power, which have found their fullest expression at Fox News.\u201d Correction: January 7, 2014 An earlier version of this article misidentified the parent company of the Fox News Channel. It is 21st Century Fox, not News Corporation. An earlier version also misidentified the organization that the television producer Randi Harrison was preparing to join. It was NBC, not CNBC. A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2014, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Biography Casts Critical Light on Fox News Chief.

Cantor said the \"continuing resolution\" would keep the government open past a midnight Wednesday (0500 GMT) deadline through Saturday, January 18.

Two small explosions followed in the western part of the capital several hours later, killing one police officer, and were likely caused by small improvised explosive devices, said a police official.

That fits the pattern of many previous attacks against Egyptian security forces, which have been growing since the popularly backed coup that removed former president Mohamed Morsi, and the subsequent violent crackdown on the former Muslim Brotherhood leader's supporters.The apparently coordinated bombings come amid deep polarization in Egypt as the military-led transition process moves forward. Egyptians approved a new Constitution in a referendum last week, and dates for presidential and parliamentary elections are to be announced soon, with many Egyptians urging Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to run for president. But many Egyptians opposed the military coup and subsequent transition, and the bombings are stoking fears that the violent backlash many warned of after police killed hundreds of Morsi supporters in August had become a reality.Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim called the bombing a \u201cvile terrorist act\u201d and vowed that police would continue their \u201cwar on terrorism.\u201d Mr. Ibrahim survived an assassination attempt in September. No group has yet claimed responsibility for today's attacks. But bystanders at the site of the first bombing in Cairo this morning, and others throughout the capital, were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood. The government has labeled the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, and government officials regularly use such language to refer to the group. Officials initially accused the Brotherhood of a Dec. 24 bombing that killed 16 people, even though a separate organization claimed responsibility for the attack. The Brotherhood, which renounced such violence decades ago, condemned the attack in a message posted on its English-language Twitter feed. Peaceful revolution against a \"fascist military coup is the only is the only path chosen by Egyptians to restore their freedoms,\" the message read, adding that the group holds the \"coup authorities\" responsible for deteriorating security and failures to apprehend the perpetrators of previous bombings.An apparently impromptu crowd gathered at the debris-littered site of the bombing soon after the blast, demonstrating angrily against the Islamist organization. \u201cThe people demand the execution of the Brotherhood!\u201d they chanted. Others declared the bombers to be infidels.\u201cThis is black terrorism.

Anger at the USMany in the crowd were also angry at the United States. One man raised a picture of Gen. Sisi, who deposed Morsi, and railed against the US for \u201csupporting terrorism and the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d Some focused their anger at the US on foreign reporters, and several journalists were assaulted by angry crowds. The blast also hit the Museum of Islamic Art across the street from the security headquarters. The building's facade was heavily damaged, and damage was visible inside the building. Egypt's antiquities minister visited the museum two hours after the blast and said there had been extensive damage to antiquities housed in the museum, which had recently been renovated.The bombings were the latest attacks in an insurgency that has grown since the military ousted Morsi and security forces killed more than 1,000 of his supporters. Since then, the bombings that were relatively common in Egypt's lawless Sinai peninsula have spread to the rest of Egypt, with small attacks on police checkpoints and police stations giving way to larger bombings.The Sinai-based militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), which has expressed admiration for Al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks. Those include the car bomb assassination attempt on the interior minister last fall, as well as the deadly December bombing in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. Police were on high alert throughout the capital after the attacks, and many Egyptians expressed worry about what will happen Saturday, the anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak. Morsi supporters had called for large protests Friday afternoon.", "published": "", "tags": null}, {"author": "By ERIK ECKHOLM", "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        <h3 class=\"kicker\"><span class=\"kicker-label\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html\">U.S.</a></span><span class=\"pipe\">|</span>National Briefing | South</h3>\n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">North Carolina: Judge Blocks Ultrasound Requirement</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n                \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"700\" data-total-count=\"700\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">A federal judge on \u00a0Friday\u00a0declared unconstitutional the state\u2019s ultrasound requirement for women seeking abortions, saying it violated the First Amendment by requiring doctors to display a fetal image and describe it even to women who covered their eyes and ears.\u00a0Judge Catherine C.

The investigators say releasing more images might identify the defector, endangering his family or former colleagues, and, they say, they cannot release the images out of respect for the victims\u2019 families.Mr. Assad\u2019s enemies say they hope the leak, first reported in The Guardian and on CNN, will cause enough revulsion in the West to prevent any deal that might leave him in place, or perhaps prod the West into more muscular steps to remove him, just as the disclosure of the Serbian massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 moved NATO to launch airstrikes in the Balkans.But even the most determined advocates of Western intervention say the images may dramatize the moral cost of inaction but are unlikely to change the policy, especially given the American aversion to another entanglement in the Middle East.\u201cI feel like we have had at least one or two Srebrenica moments in Syria already,\u201d said Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has pushed for American action. \u201cThe White House has completely hardened itself to whatever horrendous news might come out of Syria because the president doesn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201dThe photos were made public by an anonymous military policeman who had a grim role in the bureaucracy of the Syrian security apparatus, according to the lawyers\u2019 report assessing the photos\u2019 veracity.The photos were used to provide death certificates to the families of the victims without turning over the bodies, and were archived as a record that the men had been killed.After \u201cpsychological suffering\u201d caused by his job, Caesar saved the photos on a portable disk drive, and he and the disk were smuggled out of the country by antigovernment activists, the report said. The activists contacted the Qatari government, Qatar hired a London law firm, and it commissioned a team of legal and forensics experts to assess the credibility of Caesar and his photos.\u201cIt was like getting the keys to the Nazi archive,\u201d said Geoffrey Nice, one of the investigators, who previously served as the lead prosecutor in the trial of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.Rarely, Mr. Nice said, had war crimes prosecutors received so much information from a single source. It was \u201can enormous amount of material in one go,\u201d he said.The team, which included three legal experts with experience in war crimes prosecutions and three forensic analysts, interviewed Caesar extensively, examined the photos and deemed them to be credible evidence that could support charges of crimes against humanity and possibly war crimes.\u201cIt is very rare to have this kind of government-backed, industrial, machinelike, systematic torture and killing of human beings, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since Nuremberg,\u201d said David Crane, an investigator involved in examining the photos, who previously indicted President Charles G. Taylor of Liberia.That Qatar, which has bankrolled the rebels, funded the project is also likely to raise questions, though the investigators say they worked freely.The Syrian government, which characterizes the insurgency as a terrorist campaign backed by foreign powers, has not commented on the report.At the site of the peace conference, a Syrian journalist who supports the government said the timing of the release suggested a plan to undermine the Syrian government, and he questioned the photos\u2019 authenticity.\u201cWho are these people?\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cAre they innocent political prisoners or are they Al Qaeda?\u201dHuman rights groups have long accused the Syrian government of such systematic abuses, especially since the start of the uprising three years ago.\u201cIf these photographs are authentic, the torture documented is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the atrocities that are happening across the country,\u201d said Lama Fakih, one author of a 2012 report by Human Rights Watch based on interviews with more than 200 former detainees and inspections of former government torture facilities in rebel-held territory.In Washington, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said the images \u201cshow systematic violations of Syrians\u2019 human rights.\u201d\u201cWe have been committed to ensuring that Bashar al-Assad, who is the one responsible for these horrific images, cannot go on leading his country,\u201d she said, citing American efforts in the peace conference.While the report\u2019s authors hope it will create momentum for the prosecution of war crimes in Syria, they acknowledge that international politics are likely to block such action. Russia, a major Syrian ally, would probably veto any effort by the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.Others recalled how the Obama administration initially threatened missile strikes against the Syrian government after videos emerged depicting hundreds of victims of a chemical weapons attack launched by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces.\u201cHistory is full of leaders who have warned against inaction, indifference and especially against silence when it mattered most,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in an emotional address last summer, calling Mr. Assad \u201ca thug\u201d and \u201ca murderer.\u201dPeter D. Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who studies foreign policy and public opinion, said that it was an \u201ceerie parallel\u201d but that the administration is \u201cin a very different place\u201d now, investing instead in a deal with Mr. Assad to turn over his chemical weapons and a push for a negotiated end to the war.Mr. Feaver imagined that the images might provide new ammunition to those who want \u201cto go into the Oval Office, throw it down on the desk, and say, \u2018If we don\u2019t act, this is on us!\u2019 \u201dAhmed al-Ahmed, an activist in central Syria, said through Skype: \u201cThe report is nothing new for us. It just documented what has been going on all along.\u201d\u201cThere were many photos before these that were even worse,\u201d he said. Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo. Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Geneva.

The one-time U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has set up a <a href=\"http://www.boltonpac.com/\">PAC</a> and a super PAC to help hawks in the 2014 midterms, and is insistent that foreign policy should be prominent in American politics. For a man dedicated to that subject, however, he has a curious blind spot.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/ambassador-john-bolton-benghazi-iran-obama-hillarys-failure-foreign-policy/\">an exchange</a> the mustachioed raptor-enthusiast had on Hugh Hewitt's radio show:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>HH: Yesterday on this program, and people can read the transcript if they want at www.hughhewitt.com, and we posted the audio as well of Dr. Charles Krauthammer, hour-long interview like this one. He said that look, national security, foreign policy, just doesn\u2019t really matter in presidential elections. How do you respond to that?</p>\n\n<p>JB: <strong>Well, I think it has been invisible in the past couple of presidential elections</strong>. I think that\u2019s correct. But I think it would be wrong to say it doesn\u2019t matter, that it shouldn\u2019t matter, and that it couldn\u2019t matter. The fact is we now face threats around the world that are growing, some are great strategic threats, some are more immediate, but I think these threats have a direct impact on the economic well-being of the American people. I think the American people are very practical. And if they have leaders who address these issues, I think they will respond to them. I think foreign and defense policy are really surrogates for leadership. I think the people look at how our candidates address national security issues, and they say yes or no, yes, that person is qualified to sit behind the big desk at the White House. So leaving them behind is bad policy for the country. I think it\u2019s bad politics, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even accounting for Ron Paul's monologues in the primary, Mitt Romney's attempted Benghazi <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/heres-a-timeline-of-the-confusing-statements-on-libya-and-egypt/262264/\">zings</a>, and President Obama's crowing over killing Osama bin Laden, it's fair to say that foreign policy was relatively irrelevant during the 2012 election.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>But the 2008 election?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hillary Clinton probably would have won the Democratic primary if not for the fact that she supported the Iraq War while her rival opposed it. Then the general election pitted a war-hero Iraq hawk against an anti-war Democrat. What hawks can't seem to internalize is that Barack Obama didn't beat John McCain because foreign policy wasn't an issue. He beat him, in part, because foreign policy was a winning issue <em>for Obama</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it was a losing issue for the Republican Party.

ReutersA group of hawks is called a cast, an aerie, a kettle\u2014or, if John Bolton gets his way, the 114th United States Congress. The one-time U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has set up a PAC and a super PAC to help hawks in the 2014 midterms, and is insistent that foreign policy should be prominent in American politics. For a man dedicated to that subject, however, he has a curious blind spot. Here's an exchange the mustachioed raptor-enthusiast had on Hugh Hewitt's radio show: HH: Yesterday on this program, and people can read the transcript if they want at www.hughhewitt.com, and we posted the audio as well of Dr. Charles Krauthammer, hour-long interview like this one. He said that look, national security, foreign policy, just doesn\u2019t really matter in presidential elections. How do you respond to that? JB: Well, I think it has been invisible in the past couple of presidential elections. I think that\u2019s correct. But I think it would be wrong to say it doesn\u2019t matter, that it shouldn\u2019t matter, and that it couldn\u2019t matter. The fact is we now face threats around the world that are growing, some are great strategic threats, some are more immediate, but I think these threats have a direct impact on the economic well-being of the American people. I think the American people are very practical. And if they have leaders who address these issues, I think they will respond to them. I think foreign and defense policy are really surrogates for leadership. I think the people look at how our candidates address national security issues, and they say yes or no, yes, that person is qualified to sit behind the big desk at the White House. So leaving them behind is bad policy for the country. I think it\u2019s bad politics, too. Even accounting for Ron Paul's monologues in the primary, Mitt Romney's attempted Benghazi zings, and President Obama's crowing over killing Osama bin Laden, it's fair to say that foreign policy was relatively irrelevant during the 2012 election. But the 2008 election? Hillary Clinton probably would have won the Democratic primary if not for the fact that she supported the Iraq War while her rival opposed it. Then the general election pitted a war-hero Iraq hawk against an anti-war Democrat. What hawks can't seem to internalize is that Barack Obama didn't beat John McCain because foreign policy wasn't an issue. He beat him, in part, because foreign policy was a winning issue for Obama. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it was a losing issue for the Republican Party. Voters no longer trusted GOP stewardship of U.S. foreign policy because of the Iraq debacle. It wasn't so much that the GOP lost the rhetorical debate about Iraq as that they lost thousands of U.S. lives, trillions of dollars, and the war itself.

NASOC operation will be governed by precision of conduct, accuracy, timely speed and execution, surprise to keep any adversary off balance while in special operations.\u201d (I\u2019m not gonna lie \u2013 I have no clue what this quote actually means, but I digress.)Through US Africa Command (AFRICOM), US Special Operations Command, Africa (SOCAFRICA), and the Office of Security Cooperation in the US Embassy in Abuja, the United States will be helping stand up the NASOC by providing training and a limited amount of equipment.From the information I have, it sounds like NASOC will have a force up North to deal with Boko Haram, a force in the South to deal with security in the Niger Delta, a headquarters force to focus on hostage rescue, and an expeditionary force for external use \u2013 perhaps to contribute specialized capabilities for peacekeeping operations.Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know the precise size of NASOC or of its component forces. The announcement of the NASOC preceded President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s sacking of some of his Chiefs of Defense (the equivalent of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States) a few days later.As part of this reshuffle, former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, took over from Admiral Ola Sa'ad Ibrahim as Chief of Defense Staff (position equivalent to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US), Air Vice Marshal Adesola Nunayon Amosu took over for Badeh as Chief of Air Staff (position equivalent to the Air Force Chief of Staff in the US), Major General Kenneth Tobiah Jacob Minimah took over for Lieutenant General Azubike O. Ihejirika as Chief of Army Staff (position equivalent to the Army Chief of Staff in the US), and Rear Admiral Usman O. Jibrin took over from Vice Admiral Dele Joseph Ezeoba as Chief of Naval Staff (position equivalent to the Chief of Naval Operations in the US).Air Marshal Badeh, the new Chief of Defense Staff, hails from Adamawa state, which is one of three Nigerian states (the others being Borno and Yobe states) in which President Jonathan had declared a Boko Haram-related state of emergency that is set to expire in April 2014, unless it is renewed for a second time.At the moment, I do not know what, if any correlation there is between the Chiefs of Defense reshuffle and the establishment of NASOC to counter the Boko Haram insurgency. One reason US support to establish NASOC is significant is that I have not gotten the sense that the US military had as strong service-to-service relations with the Nigerian military as it would like, and working with them to establish NASOC provides opportunities to strengthen the Army-to-Army relationship.In addition, as a new command, NASOC will need to create military units from scratch, which avoids some of the tensions surrounding the vetting needed under the Leahy Amendment that have impeded bilateral security cooperation as a result of the Nigerian government\u2019s heavy-handed approach to Boko Haram in the North.(The Leahy Amendment requires that partner- nation military units that receive US security assistance are vetted to ensure that they have not been implicated in gross human rights violations.) Just to give you an example of the extent to which allegations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military had recently affected Leahy vetting: One of the ways the United States provides security assistance to Nigeria and other countries on the African continent is through Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA), which trains partner nation forces to participate in peacekeeping operations. You may recall that during the first six months of 2013, Nigeria contributed approximately one-sixth of the troops to the African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) before they had to withdraw most of their troops in July. These troops likely received ACOTA training prior to their deployment.In April, Human Rights Watch published satellite imagery from the town of Baga in Borno State, showing 2,275 destroyed and 125 severely damaged buildings, and asking the Nigerian government to investigate allegations that soldiers carried out widespread destruction and killing in the town.Although the Baga incident was just one of many allegations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military in its fight against Boko Haram, my understanding is that most military units rotate personnel through northern Nigeria, and as a result, Nigerian military units were becoming tainted by association as far as Leahy vetting goes.As a result, Nigeria\u2019s domestic handling of Boko Haram was raising questions over whether the United States would be able to support Nigerian troop contributions to Mali and other peacekeeping missions.Thus to bring us back to the establishment of NASOC and the US military\u2019s support for this effort \u2013 will the newly-created \u201dclean\u201d NASOC units be able to avoid the human rights violations that have restricted the space for US military engagement with their non-special forces counterparts?

So it was fitting that on January 1st, 420 days after Coloradans awoke to discover that, along with Washington state, theirs had become the first jurisdiction in the world to vote to remove the criminal prohibition on recreational marijuana, around 40 state-licensed pot shops flung open their doors to all-comers. Four-hour queues snaked along the streets of Denver and other cities. Swamped by newbies, many from out of state, shop staff toiled to explain the difference between sativa (which delivers a \u201ccerebral\u201d, energetic high suited to daytime use) and indica (a depressive effect; better consumed late).</p>\n<p>\u201cShould\u2019ve done it 40 years ago!\u201d growls a middle-aged man making his first purchase at Medicine Man, one of Denver\u2019s biggest retail outlets. (A home-grower, he later confides that he got bored smoking the same old strains.) For optimists, the votes in Colorado and Washington suggest that America\u2019s war on drugs is finally winding down. The casualties have been legion: 750,000 people are arrested each year for marijuana alone; the subsequent blotted records can derail lives. Some 40,000 people languish in prison for pot-related offences. Murderous gangs fill the supply gap created by prohibition.</p>\n      <aside class=\"main-content-container\">\n      <p class=\"secondary-header grey-header size-compact\">In this section</p><p class=\"secondary-header grey-header size-compact\">Related topics</p>    </aside>\n  <p/>\n<p/><div class=\"content-image-float-290 retina-290\">\n<img src=\"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20140111_USC114.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/>\n\n</div>\n<p>Public opinion appears to have reached a tipping point. Most Americans now favour legalisation; something that was unthinkable a generation ago (see chart). Advocates have waged savvy campaigns, gaining footholds by legalising marijuana for medical purposes (so far in 20 states and Washington, DC) and presenting a clean-cut, besuited image worlds away from the tie-dyed stereotypes. More states may free the weed before long.</p>\n<p>Yet legalisation is just the beginning of a process, and Colorado and Washington have taken different routes. Colorado has built on the foundations of its medical-marijuana system. Until October (and 2016 in Denver) only medical-marijuana operators may receive licences to serve recreational customers, which is why many of the shops that welcomed newcomers on January 1st have names like Citi-Med and Evergreen Apothecary. (Retailers exult that they are no longer obliged to speak of \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201cpatients\u201d.) During this time Colorado\u2019s retailers must grow at least 70% of the marijuana they sell.</p>\n<p>Washington, by contrast, is creating a recreational market from scratch; this is why its shops are not expected to open until May or so. It will have a three-tier system, with separate licences for cultivation, processing and retail. The state will determine, Soviet-style, consumers\u2019 annual needs in advance and cap overall production. The fate of its medical system, more chaotic than Colorado\u2019s, is uncertain.</p>\n<p>Under federal law, marijuana remains illegal. The feds have pounced on dispensaries in states with badly run medical systems. But in August the Department of Justice suggested it would let the experiments in Washington and Colorado proceed if they did not impede eight \u201cenforcement priorities\u201d, including stopping pot from being trafficked by gangs, sold to minors or smuggled into other states.</p>\n<p>Worryingly for Colorado, its record in these areas is not stellar. Plenty of teenagers are getting their hands on medical marijuana procured by adults. Police in neighbouring states such as Kansas complain of Coloradan marijuana flooding border areas. Colorado has a fat rule book and most dispensaries are well run, but they can do little about customers passing pot to children or taking it across state lines.

FOR reasons as hazy as a cloud of Sour Diesel smoke, the number 420 is cherished by America\u2019s stoners. So it was fitting that on January 1st, 420 days after Coloradans awoke to discover that, along with Washington state, theirs had become the first jurisdiction in the world to vote to remove the criminal prohibition on recreational marijuana, around 40 state-licensed pot shops flung open their doors to all-comers. Four-hour queues snaked along the streets of Denver and other cities. Swamped by newbies, many from out of state, shop staff toiled to explain the difference between sativa (which delivers a \u201ccerebral\u201d, energetic high suited to daytime use) and indica (a depressive effect; better consumed late). \u201cShould\u2019ve done it 40 years ago!\u201d growls a middle-aged man making his first purchase at Medicine Man, one of Denver\u2019s biggest retail outlets. (A home-grower, he later confides that he got bored smoking the same old strains.) For optimists, the votes in Colorado and Washington suggest that America\u2019s war on drugs is finally winding down. The casualties have been legion: 750,000 people are arrested each year for marijuana alone; the subsequent blotted records can derail lives. Some 40,000 people languish in prison for pot-related offences. Murderous gangs fill the supply gap created by prohibition. In this sectionRelated topics Public opinion appears to have reached a tipping point. Most Americans now favour legalisation; something that was unthinkable a generation ago (see chart). Advocates have waged savvy campaigns, gaining footholds by legalising marijuana for medical purposes (so far in 20 states and Washington, DC) and presenting a clean-cut, besuited image worlds away from the tie-dyed stereotypes. More states may free the weed before long. Yet legalisation is just the beginning of a process, and Colorado and Washington have taken different routes. Colorado has built on the foundations of its medical-marijuana system. Until October (and 2016 in Denver) only medical-marijuana operators may receive licences to serve recreational customers, which is why many of the shops that welcomed newcomers on January 1st have names like Citi-Med and Evergreen Apothecary. (Retailers exult that they are no longer obliged to speak of \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201cpatients\u201d.) During this time Colorado\u2019s retailers must grow at least 70% of the marijuana they sell. Washington, by contrast, is creating a recreational market from scratch; this is why its shops are not expected to open until May or so. It will have a three-tier system, with separate licences for cultivation, processing and retail. The state will determine, Soviet-style, consumers\u2019 annual needs in advance and cap overall production. The fate of its medical system, more chaotic than Colorado\u2019s, is uncertain. Under federal law, marijuana remains illegal. The feds have pounced on dispensaries in states with badly run medical systems. But in August the Department of Justice suggested it would let the experiments in Washington and Colorado proceed if they did not impede eight \u201cenforcement priorities\u201d, including stopping pot from being trafficked by gangs, sold to minors or smuggled into other states. Worryingly for Colorado, its record in these areas is not stellar. Plenty of teenagers are getting their hands on medical marijuana procured by adults. Police in neighbouring states such as Kansas complain of Coloradan marijuana flooding border areas. Colorado has a fat rule book and most dispensaries are well run, but they can do little about customers passing pot to children or taking it across state lines. And in Colorado (but not Washington) anyone may grow up to six marijuana plants without a licence. Legalisation may prompt people to smoke and eat more marijuana. Prices for recreational pot are comparable to those in the illicit market ($55-$60 for an eighth, according to Darin Smith of the Denver Kush Club, a retail outlet). Some non-tokers will surely be tempted to take up the habit now that they need not deal with intimidating criminals in dark alleys; others may get high more often.

But the victims have pressed for publication of the files, arguing that the documents will provide an important form of reckoning, chronicling what church officials did, and did not do, when they learned of accusations that priests had molested minors.\u201cThere can\u2019t be safety in the future unless practices that were so dangerous in the past are fully known,\u201d said Jeff Anderson, a lawyer representing many of the victims. \u201cIt really is a painful and sorrowful and frankly ugly portrait of what has been, but from that, there is hope that it will not be repeated, and to that end it brings comfort to survivors.\u201dThe documents are certain to place an uncomfortable spotlight on Cardinal Francis E. George, the archbishop of Chicago, who is one of the leading intellectuals in the American church hierarchy and who was president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 2007 to 2010, when many dioceses were grappling with the abuse crisis. Although the abuse took place before Cardinal George became archbishop, many of the victims first came forward after his arrival; some of the files concern cases in which Cardinal George\u2019s response has been questioned, including that of the Rev. Joseph R. Bennett, whose disciplinary proceeding the cardinal briefly delayed, and the Rev. Norbert J. Maday, whose prison sentence the cardinal sought to reduce.\u201cIt would be a great fulfillment of the millennium spirit to see your captive heart set free,\u201d Cardinal George wrote to the incarcerated Father Maday in 2000. But the cardinal later changed his mind. In 2007, after several more people had come forward to say they had been abused by Father Maday, the cardinal wrote to a parole commission, saying he was seeking to defrock the priest.The documents also show Cardinal George repeatedly offering to meet with victims of abuse and apologizing; in 2005 he wrote to a victim, \u201cWe have tried to apologize to all those who are suffering because of the failure on the part of some bishops to supervise priests adequately.\u201dThis month, in a letter distributed to parishes, Cardinal George acknowledged that in the 1980s, the archdiocese responded to allegations of sexual abuse \u201csometimes hesitantly,\u201d and that in the 1990s, \u201carchdiocesan policy still allowed some perpetrators a restricted form of ministry, with monitoring, that kept them from regular contact with minors.\u201d He said the response changed in 2002, when the American bishops agreed to a zero-tolerance policy that bars any priest facing a credible accusation of abuse from serving in ministry.\u201cPublishing for all to read the actual records of these crimes raises transparency to a new level,\u201d Cardinal George wrote in the letter. \u201cIt will be helpful, we pray, for some, but painful for many.\u201dThe archdiocese turned the estimated 6,000 pages of documents over to lawyers for abuse victims last Wednesday; the lawyers delayed the release for further redactions to protect victims\u2019 privacy. An archdiocesan lawyer told reporters last week that 95 percent of the allegations in the files concerned conduct before 1988, and none after 1996; 14 of the 30 accused priests are dead, and none is still serving in ministry. Cardinal George, who has been the archbishop of Chicago since 1997, has said he never met many of the accused priests.The documents will also shed new light on the handling of abusers by Cardinal George\u2019s predecessor, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin, a highly regarded figure in American Catholic history, and one of the first prominent church figures to act strongly against clergy sexual abuse. Cardinal Bernardin occasionally gave abusive priests second chances \u2014 for example, he allowed the Rev. Joseph L. Fitzharris a new parish assignment, with the caveat that the priest should not be allowed unsupervised contact with high school-age boys, after Father Fitzharris had been charged in court with sexually abusing a 15-year-old.The Archdiocese of Chicago, which is the third largest diocese in the country, has paid about $100 million to settle abuse allegations against priests.

Most of the documents have been published in an online archive, bishop-accountability.org.The release of the Chicago files comes as Cardinal George, a 77-year-old cancer survivor, is awaiting permission from the Vatican to retire.

In front of me lay the dishes she had prepared for my visit: a steamed carp, laced with strands of cilantro; julienne potatoes stir-fried with green pepper; saut\u00e9ed celery slices; braised pork cubes and eggs.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cWhen are you going back to America this time?\u201d Grandma asked, placing a piece of fish on my plate.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cI\u2019m staying this time.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">She raised her eyebrows.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I told her I hoped to do freelance writing in China and be close to home after all the years abroad.

What was I working on? What was the reporting process like? Did I take China\u2019s side? She was once a journalist herself, having worked for state-owned newspapers from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I told her I was writing about the strike at Southern Weekend, a liberal Chinese newspaper, after state censors meddled with an editorial last winter. \u201cThe censorship at the paper has always been very severe,\u201d I said. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised the reporters put up with it for so long. If I were one of them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Grandma cut me off. \u201cOf course you are surprised. You\u2019ve been abroad too long,\u201d she snapped, putting down her chopsticks with a clatter. \u201cThis is just the way Chinese journalism works. Do you understand? China is not America!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I opened my mouth to explain, but Grandma went on. The words \u201csuperior,\u201d \u201cignorant,\u201d and \u201chalf-American\u201d flew by my ears. I kept my eyes on my plate and ate the fish, trying hard to swallow.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"><span>I</span> left China for the first time in 2005, at the age of 17, to attend high school in the United States. I quickly realized that my homeland, when viewed from the outside, looked very different from what I was familiar with.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In the United States media, Taiwan was its own country. The Tiananmen massacre was better known among my American peers than my Chinese friends. As a native of China, I faced constant questioning: Do you think the one-child policy is necessary? Why are the Chinese so incensed about the Diaoyu Islands? What was the Chinese government doing to ease ethnic tensions in Xinjiang and Tibet?</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I tried to reply, searching for answers in my mind, but felt as if I were scraping the inside of an empty Nutella jar with a butter knife. So I hit the library, poring over documents and books written by both Chinese and Westerners. Slowly, my understanding of China evolved into something resembling a chaotic Impressionist painting: News and views from West and East juxtaposed each other like clashing colors and shapes, refusing to form a neat image.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But it was an image I was eager to share with friends and family at home when I returned to China two years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">One night at dinner, my mother, an editor in chief at a state publishing house, mentioned a new book she was planning to publish. \u201cIt is about the Jews,\u201d she explained, \u201cand reveals the secret behind their entrepreneurial success.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Her words made me uneasy. I had often heard Chinese talking about Jews in similarly generalized terms. Carefully, I pointed out that the book\u2019s idea sounded like a form of racial stereotyping.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cChinese people talk like this all the time, and you know it,\u201d my mother replied, throwing me an impatient look. \u201cIt\u2019s not considered offensive in China.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cBut should China have its own standard for racial sensitivity?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to hold assumptions toward races anywhere in the world. In America, my friends don\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cJust because they do it in America, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to do the same in China,\u201d she interrupted, raising her voice. \u201cThe years you spent in America have got those ideas into your head, and now everything in China seems wrong to you!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I forget how I responded, but I remember the suffocating silence in the room afterward.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Often, I find conversations about China with Chinese relatives and friends trickier to navigate than those with American acquaintances. In America, my firsthand perspective of China gave me credibility and strengthened my stories and arguments. But here in China, my time spent in America seems only to have alienated me from others. If I say something critical, it is often taken not as social commentary but as a sign of shifted loyalty, of contempt for my homeland, of uncritical worship of all things American.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Wounded by such misunderstandings, I babble in self-defense. I point out that my complaints echo those of many Chinese about air pollution, food safety, news censorship, corruption and so on. In fact, these gripes dominate discussions on Chinese social media. But such reasoning is usually of little help. The evening after my exchange with Grandma about censorship, my mother sat me down in the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Chinese journalism like that in front of Grandma in the future,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cBut Grandma complains about it all the time,\u201d I muttered.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cGrandma can complain about it,\u201d she said, looking in my eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same when you do.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"><span>W</span>hen I left China in 2005, my teachers, classmates and relatives bid me farewell with a nudge. \u201cYou will come back after finishing school, right?\u201d they asked. \u201cTo develop your motherland,\u201d they joked, before adding more seriously: \u201cPlus, you will surely have a brighter future here.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But when I saw them again after returning, many seem puzzled. \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d they ask. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you find a way to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Chinese are leaving their country in droves. Students, entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, celebrities, pregnant mothers \u2014 it seems everyone is trying to get away. They land on the campuses of New England universities, in Silicon Valley offices and Manhattan condos, in hospital beds in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Those who stay grumble about the exodus while speaking of the United States in rapt fascination.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cI hear Americans can go to hospitals for free. The health care system covers it all!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cEverybody in America can get a job, even without a college degree. Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">A friend burdened with debt to buy an apartment outside Beijing\u2019s Fifth Ring Road described the better fortune of her cousin in Virginia and sighed. \u201cShe bought a house just four years after graduating from college, and she\u2019s only a middle-school teacher!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">If I spoke of the United States this way, friends would glare in offense. I now tread carefully, avoiding out-of-context comments about China or the United States that might upset people. But sometimes, when confronted with rosy depictions of life in the United States, I can\u2019t help but trying to present a more nuanced picture.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">If my American friends inundated me with questions about China, though, my Chinese friends are usually less curious about the subtleties of life in the United States. When I try to explain the problems with American health insurance or school testing, their eyes begin to wander. After telling my friend with the cousin in Virginia about property taxes, she replied, \u201cWhat do I need to know that for. In China, you can\u2019t even afford the down payment!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I gradually realized what was happening. Like someone gazing out a window but staring only at his own reflection, many Chinese look at America in ways that are colored by their feelings toward China. The United States they see \u2014 a nation with a pristine environment, perfect schools, generous welfare and complete political transparency \u2014 is a figment of their imagination, custom-made in stark contrast to the reality we live in. This is what makes my comments about China or the United States so grating for them: The same hopes and anxieties for China that lay behind their idealized notions of America also heightened their sensitivity to criticism of China from outsiders. And that is how they saw me.

This is how things have to start,\u201d he said, though a few minutes earlier he had derided the campaign as \u201ca big show\u201d staged by the authorities.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I stayed silent the rest of the meal. Before it ended, the classmate approached with a question. \u201cI heard about something,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard you can buy a large house in a nice suburb on the East Coast for just $200,000.

During the Cold War, the United States, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each backed various factions in Afghanistan for its own gain. The result? Thirty years of proxy war that killed an estimated 1 million Afghans and created one of the world\u2019s most impoverished, fragmented, and radicalized societies.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. and other Western officials express legitimate frustration with the fractious nature of Syria\u2019s opposition. But in Syria today, a version of Afghanistan-style war-by-foreign proxy is dividing the opposition and prolonging the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Iran and Saudi Arabia, like the United States and the Soviet Union before them, are locked in an existential struggle\u2014their own Cold War, over influence in the region\u2014which is inflaming Shia-Sunni tensions. An opportunistic Russia, meanwhile, is using Syria\u2019s dissolution to extend its influence in the region as well.</p>\n\n<p>Though the Obama administration talks as if it is a central player in Syria, it is, largely, on the sidelines. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar continue to back different, often opposing, rebel groups, with no coordinated strategy. As Iran and Assad act in lock-step, Washington and its regional allies squabble.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis has proved to be a huge distraction,\u201d a recent International Crisis Group\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/egypt-syria-lebanon/syria/146-anything-but-politics-the-state-of-syria-s-political-opposition.aspx\">report concluded</a>, \u201cAt critical points, it has effectively ground coalition activity to a halt.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Syrian conflict\u2014like Afghanistan 30 years ago\u2014is spinning out of control, as each outside power pursues its own agenda. Sectarian and jihadi forces unleashed today will be difficult to rein in for years, if not decades. This week\u2019s peace conference will seem laughably quaint.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen this before. In 1982, Afghan, Pakistani, U.S., and Soviet negotiators gathered in Switzerland to try to end to the conflict in Afghanistan. Six years later, they signed the Geneva Accords, which resulted in the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan the next year.</p>\n\n<p>But the forces that the United States and its allies had released\u2014radicalism, sectarianism, tribalism, and lawlessness\u2014devoured Afghanistan in the 1990s. Thirty years later, those centrifugal forces still haunt that fractured nation.</p>\n\n<p>This week\u2019s negotiations are laudable.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, center, listens to a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (Denis Balibouse/Reuters)The United States won a short-term diplomatic victory over Iran this week. Under intense pressure from American officials, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon withdrew an invitation for Iranian officials to attend the Syria peace conference. Disinviting Tehran is the latest example of the Obama administration\u2019s continual search for easy, risk-free solutions in Syria. As the conflict destabilizes the region, however, Washington must finally face the hard choice: Either compromise with Iran, or decisively support and arm the rebels. The lack of an Iranian presence in Switzerland this week dooms the talks\u2019 prospects. Whether Tehran\u2019s actions are depraved or not, its comprehensive efforts to supply troops, munitions, and funding to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad makes the Iranian government the key foreign player in the conflict. \u201cIran is the sine qua non of the solution,\u201d said an American analyst, who closely follows Syria and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey have to feel comfortable with the outcome\u2014if there is going to be a solution.\u201d Washington must finally face the hard choice: Either compromise with Iran, or decisively support and arm the rebels.As fighting enters its third year, the dynamics in Syria increasingly resemble those of Afghanistan in the 1980s. During the Cold War, the United States, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each backed various factions in Afghanistan for its own gain. The result? Thirty years of proxy war that killed an estimated 1 million Afghans and created one of the world\u2019s most impoverished, fragmented, and radicalized societies. U.S. and other Western officials express legitimate frustration with the fractious nature of Syria\u2019s opposition. But in Syria today, a version of Afghanistan-style war-by-foreign proxy is dividing the opposition and prolonging the conflict. Iran and Saudi Arabia, like the United States and the Soviet Union before them, are locked in an existential struggle\u2014their own Cold War, over influence in the region\u2014which is inflaming Shia-Sunni tensions. An opportunistic Russia, meanwhile, is using Syria\u2019s dissolution to extend its influence in the region as well. Though the Obama administration talks as if it is a central player in Syria, it is, largely, on the sidelines. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar continue to back different, often opposing, rebel groups, with no coordinated strategy. As Iran and Assad act in lock-step, Washington and its regional allies squabble. \u201cThis has proved to be a huge distraction,\u201d a recent International Crisis Group report concluded, \u201cAt critical points, it has effectively ground coalition activity to a halt.\u201d The Syrian conflict\u2014like Afghanistan 30 years ago\u2014is spinning out of control, as each outside power pursues its own agenda. Sectarian and jihadi forces unleashed today will be difficult to rein in for years, if not decades. This week\u2019s peace conference will seem laughably quaint. We have seen this before. In 1982, Afghan, Pakistani, U.S., and Soviet negotiators gathered in Switzerland to try to end to the conflict in Afghanistan. Six years later, they signed the Geneva Accords, which resulted in the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan the next year. But the forces that the United States and its allies had released\u2014radicalism, sectarianism, tribalism, and lawlessness\u2014devoured Afghanistan in the 1990s. Thirty years later, those centrifugal forces still haunt that fractured nation. This week\u2019s negotiations are laudable. U.S. officials hope they will lead to temporary ceasefires, aid deliveries, and prisoner exchanges. They also assert that the talks might lead some members of Assad\u2019s inner circle to defect. The conference\u2019s first day, though, produced only vitriolic exchanges between the Syrian government and opposition.

All the things the couple is going to fight about or struggle with \u2013 money, disagreements, family dynamics \u2013 are at the heart of the wedding planning process.\u201d So while eloping is a tempting no-muss, no-fuss sidestepping of these issues, the core issues don\u2019t go away. They are often waiting for you in some form (though perhaps less intense) on the other side of the honeymoon.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"726\" data-total-count=\"2543\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So why not take the wedding planning process \u2013 where your needs and desires are center stage anyway \u2013 as an opportunity to make some requests of your mom, dad and stepmom for how you will all handle these kinds of conflicts going forward? Particularly if you plan to have children, these folks may be crossing paths more often at births, birthdays, vacations and holidays. You and your spouse are going to need to establish expectations about how you will handle everyone\u2019s conflicting interests to have you present at holidays, to be the first to meet the new grandchild and so forth. And these trade-offs need to be made not just inside your side of the family, but also between your family and your spouse\u2019s family.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"2777\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So, decide what you and your fianc\u00e9 want in terms of the roles you would like your parents and stepparent to play in the wedding ceremony and reception. Then take the lead and sit down and talk with each of them privately. Say:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"150\" data-total-count=\"2927\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 You mean an enormous amount to me, and I\u2019m looking forward to your being a part of our lives as a couple and as a family for years to come.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"423\" data-total-count=\"3350\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Here\u2019s the role(s) I\u2019d like you to play in the wedding, and why. If you\u2019re asking them to take what they perceive to be a lower-status role, acknowledge that: \u201cI know you\u2019d like to walk me down the aisle. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fair to my mom, and it\u2019s a real dilemma for me. This is the best solution I\u2019ve come up with. But I don\u2019t want you to hear it as my loving you any less than I do.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"156\" data-total-count=\"3506\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Look to meet their interests in other ways \u2013 ask your stepmom to do a reading or give a toast or something else that would mean something to her.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"3741\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Tell each of them: \u201cIt would mean a lot to me if you would make a special effort to make (mom/dad/stepmom) feel welcome.

So be empathetic to everyone\u2019s desire to feel publicly acknowledged and appreciated, even as you work to shape everyone\u2019s expectations for the future.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"17\" data-total-count=\"4133\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>Daughter Came Out</strong></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"634\" data-total-count=\"4767\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>Q.

My husband\u2019s brother and his family refused to attend on the grounds that their religion didn\u2019t recognize homosexuality and their belief that homosexuals should remain celibate. My husband\u2019s parents who follow the same religion did attend out of a commitment to family. I have not been able to get over this hurtful action by my brother-in-law, niece and nephews and am having serious issues with the idea of ever interacting with them again and would welcome suggestions as to how to handle this conflict. \u2014 cdm</em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"308\" data-total-count=\"5075\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>A.</strong> Congratulations to your daughter, and to your husband\u2019s parents (her grandparents) for showing up, despite their reservations. In many ways, her grandparents epitomize what it means to be family: We show up for each other, even when the decisions others are making are puzzling and even troubling to us.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"5328\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Her grandparents also offer a model for how you can handle the situation with your brother-in-law. The choice he made \u2013 in not attending \u2013 is puzzling and troubling to you. But out of commitment to family, I want to encourage you to keep showing up.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"393\" data-total-count=\"5721\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">That is not to suggest that it is easy, I know. The very hardest thing for me to handle is seeing anyone hurt one of my children \u2013 it\u2019s 100 times worse than being hurt myself. That mama bear instinct to lash out and protect your child is a reflection of how much you love her. She is lucky to have you in her corner, especially as she navigates a world that isn\u2019t 100 percent supportive.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"429\" data-total-count=\"6150\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">What you don\u2019t say is how <em>she</em> felt about her uncle and family\u2019s no-show. She may have been deeply hurt, or she may have shrugged it off, recognizing that not everyone will be instantly accepting. In either event, what she needs from you is not for you to escalate the tension in the relationship. She needs your continuing support, and your efforts to create any opportunities you can over time to encourage positive contact.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"822\" data-total-count=\"6972\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Your brother-in-law and his wife are in a difficult position and are trying to figure out how to navigate this just as much as you are. They don\u2019t have to support same-sex marriage to eventually meet (and perhaps grow to like) your daughter\u2019s partner as a person. Over time, they need to continue to be invited, and to meet your daughter\u2019s children if she and her partner have them. As your daughter and her cousins progress into adulthood, maximizing opportunities for them to stay in contact and spend time together will help prevent a rift that grows with generations. Your efforts (and hers) to reach out may be repeatedly rebuffed or met with silence. That\u2019s O.K. What won\u2019t help is to respond to your sense of judgment <em>from</em> them with judgment <em>of </em>them. That will cause everyone to retreat in hurt and anger.</p><p id=\"Moses\" class=\"ad moses-ad\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"16\" data-total-count=\"6988\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>The Loud Husband</strong></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"7339\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>Q.

Were these mannerisms in evidence when you were dating? If so, I bet they were charming, or at least well compensated for by his other positive attributes. Often the things we find quirky or entertaining when we\u2019re newly infatuated begin to rub raw and feel overbearing when that infatuation wears away and unconditional love is supposed to set in. You\u2019re not alone in feeling: \u201cI <em>do</em> love you \u2026 and I\u2019d love it if you would change.\u201d Welcome to marriage.</p><p class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"566\" data-total-count=\"8373\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">One thing to do is to step back and remember the big picture: The positive attributes that you love about your spouse and the ways that these annoyances fit into the totality of who he is, for better and for worse. Everyone is a mixed bag, and this set of aggravations may be more manageable than some you could have ended up with (serial infidelity comes to mind). I\u2019m assuming that given the big picture, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, although I understand that it\u2019s frustrating and exasperating, especially since you\u2019ve talked to him and he hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"67\" data-total-count=\"8440\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Four assumptions that are tempting, but probably don\u2019t hold true:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1153\" data-total-count=\"9593\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">1. <strong>He\u2019s behaving this way because he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings.</strong> We\u2019re not sure why his table manners are \u201cunusual\u201d or why he\u2019s not responding to your coaching. It could be that he disagrees with your assessment (\u201cMy table manners aren\u2019t that bad\u201d or \u201cI wasn\u2019t that loud\u201d) or doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s a priority (\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal\u201d). Or he may find the same behavior normal or even appealing: His table manners and conversational style may reflect the social norms in his family or where he grew up. In some families you aren\u2019t going to get a word in edgewise unless you interrupt and talk over each other, and a spirited debate is fun, not frustrating. One commenter suggested that he may have a bit of shadow Asperger\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s possible too. Or he may just have little filter between his internal voice and his external voice, causing him to interrupt and blurt out what he\u2019s thinking because he\u2019s excited or engaged in the conversation. Whatever the cause, it sounds as if it\u2019s longstanding behavior and habitual, and probably not a result of a conscious choice to ignore your concerns.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"927\" data-total-count=\"10520\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">2. <strong>The problem is obvious</strong>. Interestingly, the behavior you are describing is squarely in a blind spot for him, so it\u2019s particularly hard for him to see and understand. He doesn\u2019t watch himself eat \u2013 his eyes are on the front of his head looking out, so the one person he can\u2019t see at the table is himself. And one of the things that is hard for all of us to hear is our own voice. There is a little part of the brain just behind each ear called the S.T.S., which is dedicated to processing language. It\u2019s very active as we listen to someone else speak. But when we speak, our S.T.S. turns off. This means that we don\u2019t listen to our own voices the same way we listen to everyone else. A University College London researcher, Sophie Scott, suspects this is because we are listening to our own thoughts as we try to figure out how to say what we mean. Whatever the cause, this phenomenon explains exchanges like this:</p><aside class=\"marginalia comments-marginalia  comment-prompt-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"19\" data-total-count=\"10539\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cStop yelling!\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"24\" data-total-count=\"10563\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cI\u2019m not yelling!\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"10823\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">It also explains why hearing our own voice on a recording is such an unpleasant surprise. Theoretically we should hear ourselves speak every day of our lives, but in fact, neuroscience is starting to explain why the voice we are least familiar with is our own.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"777\" data-total-count=\"11600\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This suggests that one thing your husband needs in order to understand your feedback is to hear himself (volume, tone) the way others do. These days that\u2019s comparatively easy in terms of the technology \u2013 just put your smartphone on the table and use a recording app, as some commenters suggested in last week\u2019s post about the workplace bully. The hitch here is that in some states (12, to be exact), it\u2019s illegal to record someone without their permission (which could subject you to possible criminal prosecution or civil suit). So particularly in a workplace scenario, you\u2019ll want to check to see if you live in what\u2019s called a two-party consent state (which actually means you need <em>all</em> parties to a conversation to consent, not just two) before recording anyone.</p><p class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"954\" data-total-count=\"12554\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Wherever you live, when it comes to recording your spouse you want to be doubly careful. You don\u2019t want him to feel ambushed, or as if you\u2019re running some kind of marital sting operation. You are simply trying to help him understand your concerns. Explain your purposes: \u201cSo I know I\u2019ve complained about you speaking loudly, or interrupting, and I\u2019ve had a hard time describing what I\u2019m talking about and why it upsets me. I wondered whether it might be helpful if I could capture some of what I find upsetting on tape sometime, just so you can understand what I mean.\u201d You might even share the research I\u2019ve described above about why<em> everyone</em> has a hard time hearing himself \u2013 that\u2019s normal. Then see if he is game to give you permission to record now and again when the behavior comes up. Some people will find this interesting. Others will find it strange or even somewhat threatening. If he reacts badly, by all means, let it lie.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"12807\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">If he is willing to hear a couple of samples, then take your time. If it\u2019s till death do you part, then you have plenty of opportunity and there is no rush. And you don\u2019t need a long clip, just a couple of representative examples of what upsets you.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"13071\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Now the trickiest part: talking to him about it. Don\u2019t have the conversation in front of others, and don\u2019t have it when you\u2019re feeling frustrated with him. Wait until you remember what you like about him and when you both have time to have a real discussion.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"342\" data-total-count=\"13413\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The key is not to frame the conversation as an accusation or an \u201cI told you so\u201d but instead as an effort to help him understand what you\u2019re talking about. \u201cThe short clips I recorded help explain what I mean. I have them here, and we can either listen to them together, or you can listen to them on your own and then talk about it.\u201d</p><aside class=\"marginalia comments-marginalia  selected-comment-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"280\" data-total-count=\"13693\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Give him space to listen on his own if he wants to. Remember that listening to a recording of yourself suddenly routes your own voice through your S.T.S., and it\u2019s uncomfortable to listen to how we actually sound, especially when we\u2019re not at our best on the recording itself.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"13928\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Your job is to help him hear what upsets you and why. It\u2019s not to persuade him that you\u2019re right to be upset \u2013 whether it\u2019s right or wrong, it is. His job is to decide what to make of the information and your feelings about it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"590\" data-total-count=\"14518\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">3. <strong>Behavior is easy to change.</strong> It\u2019s easy to assume that it\u2019s easy for other people to change their behavior. But in fact, it\u2019s hard for all of us to change longstanding habits and ways of being, even something as straightforward and seemingly simple as table manners, because they are largely unconscious and habitual. So even if he understands the behavior and your feelings, he may feel as if he can\u2019t change, at least not without a lot of work. The expectation that once you mention it to him the problem should disappear probably isn\u2019t realistic (as much as we want it to be).</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"716\" data-total-count=\"15234\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">4. <strong>In happy marriages, spouses never hurt, embarrass or upset each other.</strong> It\u2019s tempting to assume that in other people\u2019s marriages \u2013 happy marriages \u2013 the spouses never do things that are frustrating or hurtful or exasperating. But of course, as human beings we inevitably step on each other\u2019s toes, disagree about important issues and occasionally behave in ways we later regret. And in these moments, we don\u2019t just want to feel loved and accepted in spite of our flaws. There\u2019s a way in which we want our spouses to love us <em>because of</em> our flaws. Their willingness to embrace even these less lovely parts of ourselves makes us feel that our spouses and family \u201cget us\u201d in a way that few others do.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"709\" data-total-count=\"15943\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So your job may be to figure out how to live with his behavior \u2013 improved or not - in the years to come with some degree of humor and tolerance. When he interrupts you, you can say, \u201cWait, hold up a minute, I\u2019m not finished. \u2026\u201d When more standard table manners really matter \u2013 your dinner at the White House, for example \u2013 you might make a special request that he pay particular attention. But the sooner you can find a place of acceptance, the better for both of you. I\u2019m guessing many of our readers can share ways they\u2019ve come to let go of the things about their own spouses that simply were not going to change \u2013 everyone in a long-term relationship has his own path for getting there.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"305\" data-total-count=\"16248\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">And finally, let others fend for themselves. It\u2019s not your job to regulate his impact on everyone else in the world. A few people may need help \u2013 the kids or your elderly aunt. But assume most are adults who can talk with him themselves if it bothers them. You don\u2019t need to be caught in the middle.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"12\" data-total-count=\"16260\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>Mom\u2019s Cult</strong></p><p class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"/><p id=\"SponLinkA\" class=\"ad text-ad middle-right-ad\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"nytimes_article_var\" data-color-bg=\"#f8f8f9\" data-font-face=\"arial\" data-font-size=\"small\" data-color-border=\"#e5e5e5\" data-color-line=\"#fff\" data-color-link=\"#9f9697\" data-color-url=\"#9f9697\" data-color-text=\"#bfbcc3\" data-ad-type=\"text\" data-safe=\"high\"/></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"863\" data-total-count=\"17123\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>Q. Over the past several years, my mother has become very involved with a religious organization that is labeled (correctly, in my opinion after observing the group) as a cult. It seems to bring her happiness and satisfaction, and thus far she has not given large amounts of money or made any dramatic life changes. However, I once accompanied her to their temple and was dismayed by the teachings. She is very proud of their new temple and wants me to go with her. I don\u2019t want to be hurtful, but I am increasingly concerned about the things this organization does \u2013 and I really don\u2019t want to go, in part because this time I might not be able to hold my tongue. I have politely demurred thus far, but my mother is so enthusiastic that she seems unable to imagine that someone else might not be. What is the best way to address this situation? </em><em>-- elizabeth</em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"316\" data-total-count=\"17439\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>A.</strong> Your mom is excited about what\u2019s happening at her temple. It\u2019s natural that she wants to share her excitement with you, and ideally, for you to share her excitement. If you shut down conversation about this important aspect of her life, you\u2019re also shutting her out and making the topic uncomfortably taboo.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"541\" data-total-count=\"17980\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So the question is whether you can find a way to be a willing and curious listener because you\u2019re interested in her, not in the cult itself. Ask about what she finds satisfying and what the church or community provides for her. You don\u2019t need to agree or disagree, just to be interested in your mom\u2019s life and how she is feeling. I bet you\u2019ll learn things about her that you didn\u2019t know before. And you\u2019ll also keep the channels of communication open in case she does start thinking about making big changes that might worry you.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"485\" data-total-count=\"18465\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">And you may need to be clear about the impact on you when she pressures you to join her: \u201cMom, I\u2019m always interested to hear about your experiences, and how you are doing. When things turn to pushing me to come with you, though, I feel uncomfortable, because it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in doing. It didn\u2019t have the same effect on me when I attended, and when you push, I think it makes me reluctant to discuss at all, which is a shame since it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"87\" data-total-count=\"18552\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">If and when it feels important, you can also share your concerns about her involvement:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"111\" data-total-count=\"18663\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cI do have some concerns about the church, and also the effect on you (describe what worries you and why).\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"224\" data-total-count=\"18887\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Don\u2019t be surprised if she defends the group by explaining that you are misunderstanding them.

Ms. Heen is a founding partner at Triad Consulting Group and a lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, where she has taught negotiation since 1995. She wrote \u201cDifficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most\u201d (Penguin, 2000), with Douglas Stone and Bruce Patton. Ms. Heen and Mr. Stone have a book coming out in March called \u201cThanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well (Even When It Is Off Base, Unfair, Poorly Delivered, and Frankly, You\u2019re Not in the Mood)\u201d (Viking, 2014). Her answers draw on insights and strategies from both books.Here is the fourth set of responses from Ms. Heen; Part 1 can be found here, Part 2 can be found here, and Part 3 can be found here. Final responses, focused on inheritance questions, will be posted on Jan. 22.Getting Through a WeddingQ. How can we get through a wedding where the mom and dad don\u2019t prefer to communicate with each other and the stepmother postures herself to be seen as an equal mother? \u2014 Suzanne Sheila Heen, an expert in negotiating conflicts. A. Rather than frame the question as \u201chow to get through a wedding where\u2026,\u201d you should probably think about it as \u201chow to get through a marriage where\u2026.\u201dA theologian said to me recently: \u201cPlanning a wedding is a microcosm of the marriage itself. All the things the couple is going to fight about or struggle with \u2013 money, disagreements, family dynamics \u2013 are at the heart of the wedding planning process.\u201d So while eloping is a tempting no-muss, no-fuss sidestepping of these issues, the core issues don\u2019t go away. They are often waiting for you in some form (though perhaps less intense) on the other side of the honeymoon.So why not take the wedding planning process \u2013 where your needs and desires are center stage anyway \u2013 as an opportunity to make some requests of your mom, dad and stepmom for how you will all handle these kinds of conflicts going forward? Particularly if you plan to have children, these folks may be crossing paths more often at births, birthdays, vacations and holidays. You and your spouse are going to need to establish expectations about how you will handle everyone\u2019s conflicting interests to have you present at holidays, to be the first to meet the new grandchild and so forth. And these trade-offs need to be made not just inside your side of the family, but also between your family and your spouse\u2019s family.So, decide what you and your fianc\u00e9 want in terms of the roles you would like your parents and stepparent to play in the wedding ceremony and reception. Then take the lead and sit down and talk with each of them privately. Say:\u00b7 You mean an enormous amount to me, and I\u2019m looking forward to your being a part of our lives as a couple and as a family for years to come.\u00b7 Here\u2019s the role(s) I\u2019d like you to play in the wedding, and why. If you\u2019re asking them to take what they perceive to be a lower-status role, acknowledge that: \u201cI know you\u2019d like to walk me down the aisle. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fair to my mom, and it\u2019s a real dilemma for me. This is the best solution I\u2019ve come up with. But I don\u2019t want you to hear it as my loving you any less than I do.\u201d\u00b7 Look to meet their interests in other ways \u2013 ask your stepmom to do a reading or give a toast or something else that would mean something to her.\u00b7 Tell each of them: \u201cIt would mean a lot to me if you would make a special effort to make (mom/dad/stepmom) feel welcome. I love you all, you have all been important to me, and it\u2019s hard on me to see tension between you.\u201dFinally, remember that while we think of weddings as \u201cabout\u201d the bride and groom, they also function as a very public statement to all of your family and friends about how you feel about your parents and stepparents. So be empathetic to everyone\u2019s desire to feel publicly acknowledged and appreciated, even as you work to shape everyone\u2019s expectations for the future.Daughter Came OutQ. My daughter recently came out to our family as gay and invited everyone to a commitment reception/celebration. My husband\u2019s brother and his family refused to attend on the grounds that their religion didn\u2019t recognize homosexuality and their belief that homosexuals should remain celibate. My husband\u2019s parents who follow the same religion did attend out of a commitment to family. I have not been able to get over this hurtful action by my brother-in-law, niece and nephews and am having serious issues with the idea of ever interacting with them again and would welcome suggestions as to how to handle this conflict. \u2014 cdmA. Congratulations to your daughter, and to your husband\u2019s parents (her grandparents) for showing up, despite their reservations. In many ways, her grandparents epitomize what it means to be family: We show up for each other, even when the decisions others are making are puzzling and even troubling to us.Her grandparents also offer a model for how you can handle the situation with your brother-in-law. The choice he made \u2013 in not attending \u2013 is puzzling and troubling to you. But out of commitment to family, I want to encourage you to keep showing up.That is not to suggest that it is easy, I know. The very hardest thing for me to handle is seeing anyone hurt one of my children \u2013 it\u2019s 100 times worse than being hurt myself. That mama bear instinct to lash out and protect your child is a reflection of how much you love her. She is lucky to have you in her corner, especially as she navigates a world that isn\u2019t 100 percent supportive.What you don\u2019t say is how she felt about her uncle and family\u2019s no-show. She may have been deeply hurt, or she may have shrugged it off, recognizing that not everyone will be instantly accepting. In either event, what she needs from you is not for you to escalate the tension in the relationship. She needs your continuing support, and your efforts to create any opportunities you can over time to encourage positive contact.Your brother-in-law and his wife are in a difficult position and are trying to figure out how to navigate this just as much as you are. They don\u2019t have to support same-sex marriage to eventually meet (and perhaps grow to like) your daughter\u2019s partner as a person. Over time, they need to continue to be invited, and to meet your daughter\u2019s children if she and her partner have them. As your daughter and her cousins progress into adulthood, maximizing opportunities for them to stay in contact and spend time together will help prevent a rift that grows with generations. Your efforts (and hers) to reach out may be repeatedly rebuffed or met with silence. That\u2019s O.K. What won\u2019t help is to respond to your sense of judgment from them with judgment of them. That will cause everyone to retreat in hurt and anger.The Loud HusbandQ. How do I talk to my spouse about social mannerisms he has that make me (and others) uncomfortable. I have tried sharing how they make me feel, but this has not brought about any change. Examples include somewhat unusual table manners, being inappropriately loud, interrupting, and taking the opposite side, just for fun, in any discussion. \u2013 AnonA. Were these mannerisms in evidence when you were dating? If so, I bet they were charming, or at least well compensated for by his other positive attributes. Often the things we find quirky or entertaining when we\u2019re newly infatuated begin to rub raw and feel overbearing when that infatuation wears away and unconditional love is supposed to set in. You\u2019re not alone in feeling: \u201cI do love you \u2026 and I\u2019d love it if you would change.\u201d Welcome to marriage.One thing to do is to step back and remember the big picture: The positive attributes that you love about your spouse and the ways that these annoyances fit into the totality of who he is, for better and for worse. Everyone is a mixed bag, and this set of aggravations may be more manageable than some you could have ended up with (serial infidelity comes to mind). I\u2019m assuming that given the big picture, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, although I understand that it\u2019s frustrating and exasperating, especially since you\u2019ve talked to him and he hasn\u2019t changed.Four assumptions that are tempting, but probably don\u2019t hold true:1. He\u2019s behaving this way because he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings. We\u2019re not sure why his table manners are \u201cunusual\u201d or why he\u2019s not responding to your coaching. It could be that he disagrees with your assessment (\u201cMy table manners aren\u2019t that bad\u201d or \u201cI wasn\u2019t that loud\u201d) or doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s a priority (\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal\u201d). Or he may find the same behavior normal or even appealing: His table manners and conversational style may reflect the social norms in his family or where he grew up. In some families you aren\u2019t going to get a word in edgewise unless you interrupt and talk over each other, and a spirited debate is fun, not frustrating. One commenter suggested that he may have a bit of shadow Asperger\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s possible too. Or he may just have little filter between his internal voice and his external voice, causing him to interrupt and blurt out what he\u2019s thinking because he\u2019s excited or engaged in the conversation. Whatever the cause, it sounds as if it\u2019s longstanding behavior and habitual, and probably not a result of a conscious choice to ignore your concerns.2. The problem is obvious. Interestingly, the behavior you are describing is squarely in a blind spot for him, so it\u2019s particularly hard for him to see and understand. He doesn\u2019t watch himself eat \u2013 his eyes are on the front of his head looking out, so the one person he can\u2019t see at the table is himself. And one of the things that is hard for all of us to hear is our own voice. There is a little part of the brain just behind each ear called the S.T.S., which is dedicated to processing language. It\u2019s very active as we listen to someone else speak. But when we speak, our S.T.S. turns off. This means that we don\u2019t listen to our own voices the same way we listen to everyone else. A University College London researcher, Sophie Scott, suspects this is because we are listening to our own thoughts as we try to figure out how to say what we mean. Whatever the cause, this phenomenon explains exchanges like this:\u201cStop yelling!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not yelling!\u201dIt also explains why hearing our own voice on a recording is such an unpleasant surprise. Theoretically we should hear ourselves speak every day of our lives, but in fact, neuroscience is starting to explain why the voice we are least familiar with is our own.This suggests that one thing your husband needs in order to understand your feedback is to hear himself (volume, tone) the way others do.

And you don\u2019t need a long clip, just a couple of representative examples of what upsets you.Now the trickiest part: talking to him about it. Don\u2019t have the conversation in front of others, and don\u2019t have it when you\u2019re feeling frustrated with him. Wait until you remember what you like about him and when you both have time to have a real discussion.The key is not to frame the conversation as an accusation or an \u201cI told you so\u201d but instead as an effort to help him understand what you\u2019re talking about. \u201cThe short clips I recorded help explain what I mean. I have them here, and we can either listen to them together, or you can listen to them on your own and then talk about it.\u201dGive him space to listen on his own if he wants to. Remember that listening to a recording of yourself suddenly routes your own voice through your S.T.S., and it\u2019s uncomfortable to listen to how we actually sound, especially when we\u2019re not at our best on the recording itself.Your job is to help him hear what upsets you and why. It\u2019s not to persuade him that you\u2019re right to be upset \u2013 whether it\u2019s right or wrong, it is. His job is to decide what to make of the information and your feelings about it.3. Behavior is easy to change. It\u2019s easy to assume that it\u2019s easy for other people to change their behavior. But in fact, it\u2019s hard for all of us to change longstanding habits and ways of being, even something as straightforward and seemingly simple as table manners, because they are largely unconscious and habitual. So even if he understands the behavior and your feelings, he may feel as if he can\u2019t change, at least not without a lot of work. The expectation that once you mention it to him the problem should disappear probably isn\u2019t realistic (as much as we want it to be).4. In happy marriages, spouses never hurt, embarrass or upset each other. It\u2019s tempting to assume that in other people\u2019s marriages \u2013 happy marriages \u2013 the spouses never do things that are frustrating or hurtful or exasperating. But of course, as human beings we inevitably step on each other\u2019s toes, disagree about important issues and occasionally behave in ways we later regret. And in these moments, we don\u2019t just want to feel loved and accepted in spite of our flaws. There\u2019s a way in which we want our spouses to love us because of our flaws. Their willingness to embrace even these less lovely parts of ourselves makes us feel that our spouses and family \u201cget us\u201d in a way that few others do.So your job may be to figure out how to live with his behavior \u2013 improved or not - in the years to come with some degree of humor and tolerance. When he interrupts you, you can say, \u201cWait, hold up a minute, I\u2019m not finished. \u2026\u201d When more standard table manners really matter \u2013 your dinner at the White House, for example \u2013 you might make a special request that he pay particular attention. But the sooner you can find a place of acceptance, the better for both of you. I\u2019m guessing many of our readers can share ways they\u2019ve come to let go of the things about their own spouses that simply were not going to change \u2013 everyone in a long-term relationship has his own path for getting there.And finally, let others fend for themselves. It\u2019s not your job to regulate his impact on everyone else in the world. A few people may need help \u2013 the kids or your elderly aunt. But assume most are adults who can talk with him themselves if it bothers them. You don\u2019t need to be caught in the middle.Mom\u2019s CultQ. Over the past several years, my mother has become very involved with a religious organization that is labeled (correctly, in my opinion after observing the group) as a cult. It seems to bring her happiness and satisfaction, and thus far she has not given large amounts of money or made any dramatic life changes. However, I once accompanied her to their temple and was dismayed by the teachings. She is very proud of their new temple and wants me to go with her. I don\u2019t want to be hurtful, but I am increasingly concerned about the things this organization does \u2013 and I really don\u2019t want to go, in part because this time I might not be able to hold my tongue. I have politely demurred thus far, but my mother is so enthusiastic that she seems unable to imagine that someone else might not be. What is the best way to address this situation? -- elizabethA. Your mom is excited about what\u2019s happening at her temple. It\u2019s natural that she wants to share her excitement with you, and ideally, for you to share her excitement. If you shut down conversation about this important aspect of her life, you\u2019re also shutting her out and making the topic uncomfortably taboo.So the question is whether you can find a way to be a willing and curious listener because you\u2019re interested in her, not in the cult itself. Ask about what she finds satisfying and what the church or community provides for her. You don\u2019t need to agree or disagree, just to be interested in your mom\u2019s life and how she is feeling. I bet you\u2019ll learn things about her that you didn\u2019t know before. And you\u2019ll also keep the channels of communication open in case she does start thinking about making big changes that might worry you.And you may need to be clear about the impact on you when she pressures you to join her: \u201cMom, I\u2019m always interested to hear about your experiences, and how you are doing. When things turn to pushing me to come with you, though, I feel uncomfortable, because it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in doing. It didn\u2019t have the same effect on me when I attended, and when you push, I think it makes me reluctant to discuss at all, which is a shame since it\u2019s important to you.\u201dIf and when it feels important, you can also share your concerns about her involvement:\u201cI do have some concerns about the church, and also the effect on you (describe what worries you and why).\u201dDon\u2019t be surprised if she defends the group by explaining that you are misunderstanding them. However she reacts in the moment, voicing your concerns plants a seed that may or may not take root at some point in the future.And, if she starts thinking about big amounts of money or changes, you can add:\u201cMom, obviously at the end of the day, this is your decision. And I want you to know that I\u2019m concerned about this not because I want to stand in the way of something that\u2019s important to you, and not because I\u2019m worried about inheritance in any way. But because I want to help protect your ability to be financially secure long term (or add what concerns you have about it).\u201dYour goal isn\u2019t to change your mom\u2019s mind \u2013 she is the only one who can change her mind. It is to stay connected with her, and that means staying connected to what excites, worries, comforts or inspires her, even while you\u2019re clear that joining this group isn\u2019t for you. It won\u2019t be an easy line to walk, and I admire your commitment to finding some way to navigate the situation with your mom.Good luck!NEXT WEEK: Inheritance disputes.", "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 12:00:01 GMT", "tags": ["Elder Care", "Inheritance and Estate Taxes", "Wills and Estates", "Baby Boomers", "Families and Family Life", "Emotions", "Anxiety and Stress"]}, {"author": "Adam Century", "html": "<html><body><div><p class=\"dek\">\n            Drunk officials, texting teens, and the decline of China\u2019s creation myth        </p>\n    \n    <div class=\"article-content\">\n\n                \n                \n        <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/BikeLongMarch/bb6d5bc2b.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Adam's bike rests on a mountain in China's Guizhou province.

Xi has <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577063-chinas-new-leader-has-been-quick-consolidate-his-power-what-does-he-now-want-his\">proclaimed</a> a \u201cChinese dream\u201d\u2014one of national strength and prosperity\u2014and he has <a href=\"http://news.163.com/13/0713/03/93KOUOPI00014Q4P.html\">visited</a> key sites along the Long March to preach this message, often alluding to the Party\u2019s early <a href=\"http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/05zjnews/system/2006/10/23/007940894.shtml\">\u201cglory days\u201d</a> in order to convey a sense of Communist revival.</p>\n\n<p>But the Chinese people themselves seem to be forging their own dream\u2014marching ahead into the future as Mr. Xi reaches into the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early June, I began my journey in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the Communist power base throughout the early 1930s and the starting point of the Long March. With a population of roughly 600,000, Ruijin resembles the more than 2,000 other county-level cities in China. Motorcycle taxis lined People\u2019s Boulevard and hundreds of shopkeepers hawked everything from knock-off Nikes to sink faucets.</p>\n\n<p>But a short ride out of town revealed an alternate universe of Communist relics and monuments, including a multitude of Chairman Mao statues: fat Maos and thin ones; a buff Mao digging a well, and a young, handsome Mao speaking at a rally. I stopped counting at nine.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite discovery was a nearly 100-foot-tall sculpture of a Communist Party emblem\u2014a blazing red star with a globe bursting from the center\u2014in a large square across from a row of Chinese characters that read: \u201cMay the spirit of the Chinese Soviet forever shine bright.\u201d A five-minute walk from the city center, the square was empty when I visited on a warm Saturday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Well, mostly empty: I spotted a teenage couple that had chosen the site as a place to canoodle in secret. Adolescent dating is still frowned upon in China and prohibited in schools. The couple blushed and stared at the pavement as I walked by their shaded nook, somewhere between the characters meaning \u201cforever\u201d and \u201cshine.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/SovietLongMarch/0d009e246.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">A deserted square in the former Communist Party power base of Ruijin with a monument to Chinese-Soviet solidarity (Adam Century)</figcaption></figure><p>From Ruijin, I rode about 500 miles westward into Guangxi province, traveling past the factories of coastal Guangdong and the jagged mountain chains of southern Hunan province. For decades, Chinese history textbooks have insisted that the Long March <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070311102040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/03/wmao03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/04/03/ixworld.html\">covered</a> 8,000 miles, but the figure, like many things in history, is more fable than fact\u2014it derives from a rough estimate made by Chairman Mao more than 70 years ago. (The actual figure is between 3,700 and 5,000 miles, and in total my trip covered just under 5,000 miles.) Only recently have historians\u2014both in China and abroad\u2014begun calling certain chapters of the march into question, bridging the chasm between the Party-bred legend and the historical truth.</p>\n\n<p>Many Chinese, for example, are still unaware that Mao spent the first several months of the Long March consigned to the Party\u2019s periphery, a punishment for having excessively cracked down on political opponents while in Jiangxi. But, in a stroke of luck, this demotion allowed him to escape culpability for one of the Red Army\u2019s most catastrophic defeats\u2014the Battle of the Xiang River, where the Communists were nearly thwarted by superior, U.S.-supplied Nationalist forces. A memorial dedicated to the battle, erected on the banks of the Xiang River in Guangxi, claims that 50,000 Red Army soldiers were \u201csacrificed\u201d; recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-March-Communist-Founding/dp/B008SMGP6A\">scholarship</a> on the march suggests that at least half of them actually deserted.</p>\n\n<p>As the Red Army fled from the Xiang River deeper into China\u2019s interior, Mao connived behind the scenes (as he so often did), forging connections in preparation for an important meeting in Zunyi, where he masterfully orchestrated his own political rise. Today, museum exhibits in this area refer to Mao\u2019s increased prominence as the \u201cturning point\u201d of the Long March and, thus, the <a href=\"http://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev\">Chinese revolution</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After traversing the mountains of Guizhou and Yunnan, I rode north toward the site of the Luding Bridge battle, where a small group of Red Army soldiers are said to have outfought a Nationalist brigade and three regiments, securing passage across the strategically important Dadu River. This was the signature event of the entire march: Under heavy enemy fire, Communist soldiers are alleged to have crawled across the bare iron chains of the ancient bridge, whose planks had been removed by the Nationalists. (What actually happened at Luding may have been far more mundane: Years later, Chinese leader and Long March veteran Deng Xiaoping <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=-WZ3j4USEzgC&amp;pg=PT244&amp;lpg=PT244&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CIn+fact,+it+was+a+very+easy+military+operation+but+we+felt+we+had+to+dramatize+it.%E2%80%9D%29&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=23vV6bcVFk&amp;sig=w6un7MnN4zSexMiXORl6wKWdtc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wh3QUoq5HMfFsATtw4CADA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CIn%20fact%2C%20it%20was%20a%20very%20easy%20military%20operation%20but%20we%20felt%20we%20had%20to%20dramatize%20it.%E2%80%9D%29&amp;f=false\">reportedly told</a> former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski that, \u201cIn fact, it was a very easy military operation \u2026 but we felt we had to dramatize it.\u201d)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>One of the perks of Communist Party membership today is that the government sponsors educational field trips for its more than 85 million <a href=\"http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/206972/206974/8305636.html\">members</a>, many of which involve visits to \u201cred tourism\u201d sites and are often followed by <em>baijiu-</em>filled banquets. After the inebriated cadres left the museum in Luding, slurred questions echoing behind them (\u201cAre you <em>sure</em> you\u2019re not Chinese?\u201d), the tour guide, a young woman named Yang Yi with dyed reddish hair, told me that roughly 90 percent of the museum\u2019s visitors are part of government field trips. \u201cThese visitors are almost all older men who have been forced to visit the museum to fulfill their Communist Party responsibilities. They never ask questions.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/LudingLongMarch/aeb054c14.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Luding Bridge, the most celebrated site on China's Long March (Adam Century)</figcaption></figure><p>At the summit of <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/travel/Ningxia/2012-06/13/content_25658213.htm\">Liupan Mountain</a> in the Ningxia region, where Mao is said to have coined the name \u201cLong March,\u201d I found a sprawling museum that was empty except for a 67-year-old military veteran and his adolescent granddaughter.

More than <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/18/world/la-fg-china-caves-20120318\">30 million</a> Chinese still live in caves that are dug into such cliffs. Throughout my journey, I boarded with local families or slept in discount rooms in village hotels, but as I approached Yan\u2019an, I took shelter in these cave-like dwellings. Reinforced with brick masonry and dug deep into the bases of mountains, the lodgings offered a respite from the summer sun. In <em>Red Star Over China</em>, the classic 1937 account of life in Yan\u2019an, U.S. journalist Edgar Snow <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Red-Star-over-China-Communism/dp/0802150934\">remarked</a> that the city\u2019s Red Army University \u201cwas probably the world\u2019s only seat of \u2018higher learning\u2019 whose classrooms were bombproof caves, with chairs and desks of stone and brick, and blackboards and walls of limestone and clay.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chinese often refer to Yan\u2019an as the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/102775/100668/204459/8277163.html\">\u201cRevolutionary Holy Land\u201d</a> and some even described it to me as the \u201cJerusalem of the East.\u201d In spite of the hype, Yan\u2019an looked like the other Chinese cities that I passed through on my trip: a crowded downtown intersection featured KFCs and a Pizza Hut, and vehicles zigzagged to the tune of drill-work and car horns. The air was dusty, and the river, which once flowed through the city center, had been reduced to a dry creek bed.</p>\n\n<p>At the Date Garden, the Party\u2019s temporary headquarters when they reached Yan\u2019an in 1935, I came upon a group of several hundred Chinese soldiers on a Party field trip, a handful of whom were solemnly pledging allegiance to the Communist Party, a requisite ritual to gain Party membership. The pledge begins with unremarkable promises to \u201cServe the Chinese people,\u201d but then escalates to vows like \u201cNever reveal the Party\u2019s secrets.\u201d Soldiers shooed me away as the new Communist devotees made their final promise: \u201cNever betray the Party.\u201d</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>Among the Chinese people whom I met on the road, my Long March project usually elicited one of two responses, depending on age. Older people tended to express admiration for my trip. For many of them, the journey was so entwined with the nationalist propaganda of their upbringings that they automatically interpreted my trip as a form of heroism. They lauded my \u201cpatriotic spirit\u201d and sometimes even offered to treat me to dinner.

For decades, the Long March has been a critical element of the Communist propaganda narrative, providing the Party with a veneer of ruggedness and frugality at a time when its top leaders have become a pampered elite. This summer, in an attempt to better understand the Long March\u2019s evolving legacy in contemporary China, I retraced the entire route by motorcycle, traveling from Jiangxi province to Yan\u2019an, the Shaanxi city that served as the Communist headquarters from 1936 to 1948. As I rode my motorcycle across the countryside, stopping at every village, city, and site associated with the march, I found evidence of a myth in decline: new, cavernous Long March museums devoid of visitors; memorials crumbling from neglect, weeds sprouting from their bases; and, most strikingly, the complete disengagement\u2014even disdain\u2014of China\u2019s youth. This disinterest comes in spite of massive propaganda efforts in recent years, and especially since President Xi Jinping took office a year ago, to promote the Communist values that the Long March embodies. Xi has proclaimed a \u201cChinese dream\u201d\u2014one of national strength and prosperity\u2014and he has visited key sites along the Long March to preach this message, often alluding to the Party\u2019s early \u201cglory days\u201d in order to convey a sense of Communist revival. But the Chinese people themselves seem to be forging their own dream\u2014marching ahead into the future as Mr. Xi reaches into the past. In early June, I began my journey in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the Communist power base throughout the early 1930s and the starting point of the Long March. With a population of roughly 600,000, Ruijin resembles the more than 2,000 other county-level cities in China. Motorcycle taxis lined People\u2019s Boulevard and hundreds of shopkeepers hawked everything from knock-off Nikes to sink faucets. But a short ride out of town revealed an alternate universe of Communist relics and monuments, including a multitude of Chairman Mao statues: fat Maos and thin ones; a buff Mao digging a well, and a young, handsome Mao speaking at a rally. I stopped counting at nine. My favorite discovery was a nearly 100-foot-tall sculpture of a Communist Party emblem\u2014a blazing red star with a globe bursting from the center\u2014in a large square across from a row of Chinese characters that read: \u201cMay the spirit of the Chinese Soviet forever shine bright.\u201d A five-minute walk from the city center, the square was empty when I visited on a warm Saturday afternoon. Well, mostly empty: I spotted a teenage couple that had chosen the site as a place to canoodle in secret. Adolescent dating is still frowned upon in China and prohibited in schools. The couple blushed and stared at the pavement as I walked by their shaded nook, somewhere between the characters meaning \u201cforever\u201d and \u201cshine.\u201d A deserted square in the former Communist Party power base of Ruijin with a monument to Chinese-Soviet solidarity (Adam Century)From Ruijin, I rode about 500 miles westward into Guangxi province, traveling past the factories of coastal Guangdong and the jagged mountain chains of southern Hunan province. For decades, Chinese history textbooks have insisted that the Long March covered 8,000 miles, but the figure, like many things in history, is more fable than fact\u2014it derives from a rough estimate made by Chairman Mao more than 70 years ago. (The actual figure is between 3,700 and 5,000 miles, and in total my trip covered just under 5,000 miles.) Only recently have historians\u2014both in China and abroad\u2014begun calling certain chapters of the march into question, bridging the chasm between the Party-bred legend and the historical truth. Many Chinese, for example, are still unaware that Mao spent the first several months of the Long March consigned to the Party\u2019s periphery, a punishment for having excessively cracked down on political opponents while in Jiangxi. But, in a stroke of luck, this demotion allowed him to escape culpability for one of the Red Army\u2019s most catastrophic defeats\u2014the Battle of the Xiang River, where the Communists were nearly thwarted by superior, U.S.-supplied Nationalist forces. A memorial dedicated to the battle, erected on the banks of the Xiang River in Guangxi, claims that 50,000 Red Army soldiers were \u201csacrificed\u201d; recent scholarship on the march suggests that at least half of them actually deserted. As the Red Army fled from the Xiang River deeper into China\u2019s interior, Mao connived behind the scenes (as he so often did), forging connections in preparation for an important meeting in Zunyi, where he masterfully orchestrated his own political rise. Today, museum exhibits in this area refer to Mao\u2019s increased prominence as the \u201cturning point\u201d of the Long March and, thus, the Chinese revolution. After traversing the mountains of Guizhou and Yunnan, I rode north toward the site of the Luding Bridge battle, where a small group of Red Army soldiers are said to have outfought a Nationalist brigade and three regiments, securing passage across the strategically important Dadu River. This was the signature event of the entire march: Under heavy enemy fire, Communist soldiers are alleged to have crawled across the bare iron chains of the ancient bridge, whose planks had been removed by the Nationalists. (What actually happened at Luding may have been far more mundane: Years later, Chinese leader and Long March veteran Deng Xiaoping reportedly told former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski that, \u201cIn fact, it was a very easy military operation \u2026 but we felt we had to dramatize it.\u201d) *** One of the perks of Communist Party membership today is that the government sponsors educational field trips for its more than 85 million members, many of which involve visits to \u201cred tourism\u201d sites and are often followed by baijiu-filled banquets. After the inebriated cadres left the museum in Luding, slurred questions echoing behind them (\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not Chinese?\u201d), the tour guide, a young woman named Yang Yi with dyed reddish hair, told me that roughly 90 percent of the museum\u2019s visitors are part of government field trips. \u201cThese visitors are almost all older men who have been forced to visit the museum to fulfill their Communist Party responsibilities. They never ask questions.\u201d Luding Bridge, the most celebrated site on China's Long March (Adam Century)At the summit of Liupan Mountain in the Ningxia region, where Mao is said to have coined the name \u201cLong March,\u201d I found a sprawling museum that was empty except for a 67-year-old military veteran and his adolescent granddaughter. Like most Chinese red tourism sites, the final exhibition room featured pictures of famous Party leaders visiting the venue. \u201cYou see these photos,\u201d the veteran told his granddaughter, \u201cthey prove that history is still important.\u201d Sporting earphones and absorbed with her smartphone, it was unclear whether she even heard him. Riding east, the scenery increasingly came to resemble the dry loess cliffs that are common in Yan\u2019an, the endpoint of the Long March. More than 30 million Chinese still live in caves that are dug into such cliffs. Throughout my journey, I boarded with local families or slept in discount rooms in village hotels, but as I approached Yan\u2019an, I took shelter in these cave-like dwellings. Reinforced with brick masonry and dug deep into the bases of mountains, the lodgings offered a respite from the summer sun. In Red Star Over China, the classic 1937 account of life in Yan\u2019an, U.S. journalist Edgar Snow remarked that the city\u2019s Red Army University \u201cwas probably the world\u2019s only seat of \u2018higher learning\u2019 whose classrooms were bombproof caves, with chairs and desks of stone and brick, and blackboards and walls of limestone and clay.\u201d Chinese often refer to Yan\u2019an as the \u201cRevolutionary Holy Land\u201d and some even described it to me as the \u201cJerusalem of the East.\u201d In spite of the hype, Yan\u2019an looked like the other Chinese cities that I passed through on my trip: a crowded downtown intersection featured KFCs and a Pizza Hut, and vehicles zigzagged to the tune of drill-work and car horns. The air was dusty, and the river, which once flowed through the city center, had been reduced to a dry creek bed. At the Date Garden, the Party\u2019s temporary headquarters when they reached Yan\u2019an in 1935, I came upon a group of several hundred Chinese soldiers on a Party field trip, a handful of whom were solemnly pledging allegiance to the Communist Party, a requisite ritual to gain Party membership. The pledge begins with unremarkable promises to \u201cServe the Chinese people,\u201d but then escalates to vows like \u201cNever reveal the Party\u2019s secrets.\u201d Soldiers shooed me away as the new Communist devotees made their final promise: \u201cNever betray the Party.\u201d *** Among the Chinese people whom I met on the road, my Long March project usually elicited one of two responses, depending on age. Older people tended to express admiration for my trip. For many of them, the journey was so entwined with the nationalist propaganda of their upbringings that they automatically interpreted my trip as a form of heroism. They lauded my \u201cpatriotic spirit\u201d and sometimes even offered to treat me to dinner. I initially objected to being mistaken for a Mao fanatic, but soon learned to be quiet and enjoy the free food. I initially objected to being mistaken for a Mao fanatic, but soon learned to be quiet and enjoy the free food.Young people, on the other hand, seemed baffled by my desire to investigate the Long March. \u201cWhy would you ever want to retrace the Long March?\u201d Wang Zengfeng, a college student whom I met in western Sichuan, asked me. \u201cDon\u2019t you have better things to do with your time?\u201d For Wang and his peers, members of the post-1980s generation that came of age under the influence of the Internet and Hollywood blockbusters, life has been about forging new roads\u2014 finding a privileged seat on China\u2019s breakneck economic bandwagon. A bike repair shop in Sichuan province (Adam Century)In early December, months after I completed my journey, China Newsweek, a popular Chinese-language weekly magazine, published a three-page expose on me entitled \u201cAn American\u2019s Chinese \u2018Long March.\u2019\u201d I was struck by how open and candid the journalist was during our interview\u2014we discussed many of the more controversial chapters of the march, as well as Mao\u2019s legacy, which is being reexamined in the aftermath of the 120th anniversary of the chairman\u2019s birth on December 26, 2013. But the final piece was sterile and uncritical of the Communist Party\u2019s account, passing me off as a Mao enthusiast. At one point, the author even compared me to Norman Bethune, the Canadian doctor who treated Mao Zedong in the 1930s and died on the battlefield, sacrificing himself, according to Chinese Party histories, \u201cfor the Communist revolution.\u201d The day that the China Newsweek article came out, I stopped at a newsstand near my house to pick up a copy. Right after I located the piece\u2014which featured a full-page picture of me on my motorcycle\u2014I heard the young vendor ask, \u201cIs that really you?\u201d I looked up and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re really weird,\u201d he chuckled, and shook his head. \u201cEven us Chinese don\u2019t believe that stuff.\u201d", "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:27:29 GMT", "tags": ["International"]}, {"author": "By JEREMY W.

Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency WASHINGTON \u2014 When the Republican National Committee gathers for its winter meeting here on Wednesday, the action will start a few hours late to accommodate anyone who wants to stop first at the March for Life, the annual anti-abortion demonstration on the National Mall. And if they need a lift to the meeting afterward, they can hop on a free shuttle, courtesy of the Republican Party.\u201cWe thought it only fitting for our members to attend the march,\u201d said Reince Priebus, the party chairman.Abortion is becoming an unexpectedly animating issue in the 2014 midterm elections. Republicans, through state ballot initiatives and legislation in Congress, are using it to stoke enthusiasm among core supporters. Democrats, mindful of how potent the subject has been in recent campaigns like last year\u2019s governor\u2019s race in Virginia, are looking to rally female voters by portraying their conservative opponents as callous on women\u2019s issues.\u201cRepublicans have turned the floor of the House into the battleground for their relentless war on women\u2019s health care and freedoms,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cEvery time they launch another extreme attack against women\u2019s rights, they lose more ground with women voters.\u201d Reince Priebus Drew Angerer/The New York Times Aware that their candidates at times have struck the wrong tone on issues of women\u2019s health, Republicans in some states are now framing abortion in an economic context, arguing, for example, that the new federal health law uses public money to subsidize abortion coverage. In the House in the coming weeks, Republicans will make passing the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d one of their top priorities this year.Democrats say their success this year will depend on how close they can come, given lower turnout, to President Obama\u2019s overwhelming margins with female voters; in 2008, he enjoyed a 14-point advantage among women, and in 2012, it was 12 points.The fraught politics of women\u2019s health care are already surfacing, as restrictions on abortion are appearing on state ballots and becoming the focus of debate in congressional races \u2014 many in places like North Carolina and Colorado that could hold the key to whether Republicans can sweep Democrats from power in the Senate and maintain their grip on the House.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a niche issue anymore,\u201d said Drew Lieberman, a vice president at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a political consultancy concern, who has advised Democratic congressional candidates and has done polling for Naral Pro-Choice America.In North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat in a difficult re-election fight, and her allies plan to make an issue of the new restrictions on abortion approved by the Republican-led state legislature.In Colorado, where Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, says anger over the Affordable Care Act could hurt his chances, social conservatives have succeeded in placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would enshrine legal protections for fetuses. Even if it fails, similar \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures in Colorado and elsewhere have given Republican turnout a boost in years past.In Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley could face a similar situation if supporters of an initiative there succeed in getting an anti-abortion measure with a fiscally conservative twist on the ballot: the measure seeks to outlaw the use of state funds to pay for any abortion unless the mother is in grave medical danger.\u201cWe don\u2019t make this a pro-life thing,\u201d said Jeff Jimerson, who is organizing the petition drive. \u201cThis is a pro-taxpayer thing. There are a lot of libertarians in Oregon, people who don\u2019t really care what you do, just don\u2019t make me pay for it.\u201dCoupling the issue of abortion with a subject important to Republicans\u2019 Tea Party followers \u2014 government spending \u2014 is one way the party is recalibrating its election-year message. Republicans say that by framing the abortion debate in terms of fiscal conservatism, they can make a connection to the issue they believe will ultimately decide who controls Congress next year \u2014 the Affordable Care Act.\u201cFor a lot of members politically it ties into the issue they want to be talking about this election, which is Obamacare,\u201d said Tom McClusky, vice president for government affairs for the March for Life.Republican presidential candidates have almost universally opposed abortion rights. When Arlen Specter, then a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, ran for president in 1995 and declared he wanted to \u201ctake abortion out of politics,\u201d the right balked, and his candidacy was short-lived. But Republicans do see a danger in talking about it the wrong way.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of tone as well as substance,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who noted how Republicans hurt themselves in 2012 by picking congressional candidates like Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, whose infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost him his Senate candidacy and put his entire party on the defensive over women\u2019s issues.\u201cWhat do they want us to talk about?\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cRape and incest. What should the pro-life candidate talk about? Late-term abortions, sex-selection and Kermit Gosnell.\u201d Dr. Gosnell was convicted in Philadelphia last year of murdering babies after failed abortions.Mr. Priebus, the Republican chairman, will attend the March for Life this week, rare for a party leader. So will Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. In years past, Republican presidents have addressed the march by phone or video message to avoid speaking in person.Nowhere was the power of the abortion issue more evident recently than in the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, where the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, won in November in part because women preferred him by nine percentage points over the Republican, Ken Cuccinelli, whom Democrats portrayed as extreme on women\u2019s issues.Nearly one-third \u2014 about $4.6 million \u2014 of the $16.4 million that Democrats and their allies spent on broadcast television advertising in Virginia last year dealt with abortion or birth control, according to an analysis by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising.Abortion rights groups have built targeting models that allow them to predict an individual voter\u2019s position on women\u2019s health issues. These models, along with similar ones built by the Obama campaign, were factors not just in Virginia last year but also in Democratic electoral victories in 2012.One state that Naral and Planned Parenthood Action Fund are studying is North Carolina, where they see parallels to Virginia. Demographic changes there are giving Democrats hope that it could swing back into their column.One of the leading contenders to be Ms. Hagan\u2019s opponent in November is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the State House, who voted for the tough restrictions on abortion. Democrats believe that would set them up to make the same kinds of sharp attacks that helped them prevail over Mr. Cuccinelli in November and over Mitt Romney in 2012.While Democrats say such measures seeking to restrict abortions could stir votes, they acknowledge the limits of midterm turnout. \u201cOff-year elections are difficult,\u201d said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cYou have lower turnout, and a lot of drop-off voters are women. So in a lot of ways, making sure women are aware and voting is important.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Parties Seize On Abortion Issues in Midterm Race.

Sharon's cousin, Slava Shnerov, 71, who had played with \"Arik\" as a child and last saw him comatose in a hospital bed eight years ago, had not been included on the list of special guests. \"No one informed me,\" she said, without bitterness. \"This is a sad day for Israel, not just the family.\"The VIP area was crowded with Israeli political and military figures and dignitaries from almost two dozen countries. Tony Blair was seated next to Israel's hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman; the US vice-president, Joe Biden, was also present. Only the Czechs sent a head of state.Sharon died on Saturday after spending eight years in a coma that struck him at the height of a decades-long career which saw him lauded as a military hero and statesman, but also reviled as a warmongering criminal. He was 85.Speaking on Monday morning at the Knesset ceremony, Biden urged Israelis to remember Sharon's mistakes as well as his triumphs, and acknowledged US differences with the former prime minister. But he added: \"History will judge that he lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood.\"Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet, said Sharon had fought for the state of Israel both in the field of war and the diplomacy chamber. \"He had the imagination to know that genuine peace, if attainable with honour and dignity both for Arabs and Israelis, was the anchor ultimately for Israel's security.\"Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that he had not always seen eye to eye with Sharon, particularly over the pullout from Gaza. But he added: \"Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we must stand firm. We are sticking to these principles.\"Security was very tight in the area surrounding Sharon's Shikmim farm for the funeral. No private cars were allowed access \u2013 instead special coaches were laid on from a nearby technical college, where mourners' possessions were passed through scanners.A helicopter circled overhead and a surveillance balloon hovered nearby. An area on top of a hill near to the spot where Sharon was laid to rest alongside his late wife, Lily, was penned off with crash barriers. At least six huge screens showed the proceedings live.\"Arik, the commander. You had many titles over the years, but I think this is the one that suited you most,\" said the IDF's Chief of General Staff, Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz, at the graveside.\"Generations of soldiers came to salute you for the last time today \u2026 I came to salute you too.\"", "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 14:27:42 GMT", "tags": ["Ariel Sharon", "theguardian.com", "Israel", "World news", "News", "World news"]}, {"author": null, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"story-body\">\n    \t\t  <span class=\"story-date\">&#13;\n    <span class=\"date\">10 January 2014</span>&#13;\n<span class=\"time-text\">Last updated at </span><span class=\"time\">21:53 ET</span>&#13;\n\t  &#13;\n</span>&#13;\n&#13;\n\t&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\t<h1 class=\"story-header\">Army launches \u00a33m recruitment drive</h1>&#13;\n&#13;\n     &#13;\n         &#13;\n \n    \n    \n\t\t\n        <div class=\"caption body-width\">&#13;\n  <img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72213000/jpg/_72213395_emb_hqscot-2014-001-0167.jpg\" alt=\"Army campaign\"/>&#13;\n&#13;\n    <span>The campaign has been dubbed 'More than meets the eye'</span>&#13;\n  </div>&#13;\n\t&#13;\n                      <p class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">The British army is launching a \u00a33m recruitment campaign aimed at boosting both the regular and reserve forces. </p>&#13;\n        <p>As part of the drive, titled \"More than meets the eye\", television and cinema adverts will show how the Army Reserve is integrated with its counterpart. </p>&#13;\n        <p>The Army is being cut from 100,000 troops to some 82,000, but the Ministry of Defence says it needs new recruits. </p>&#13;\n        <p>It wants to increase the size of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to 30,000, but has failed to meet its targets so far.</p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">'Challenge and adventure'</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>Meanwhile, a poll commissioned by the Army to mark the campaign's launch suggested that 23% of people were not satisfied with their current career.</p>&#13;\n        <p>When asked what was missing 30% said a decent salary; 27% said excellent training and personal development; 25% said a challenging and exciting role; 35% said UK and overseas travel; and 18% said getting paid while getting qualifications.</p>&#13;\n        <p>The research, carried out by OnePoll, surveyed 2,000 people in December 2013.</p>&#13;\n        <p>BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said this was the Army's third campaign in a year - stressing it had so far failed to meet its targets for recruiting reservists.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"In 2014, the Army will continue to recruit new full-time soldiers and look to increase the trained strength of part-time soldiers.</p>&#13;\n        <p>\"Army reserves will be critical to mounting military operations in the future and we intend to grow the number significantly by 2018.\"</p>&#13;\n        <p>Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Peter Wall, said: \"The Army offers people unique opportunities for challenge and adventure, both at home and overseas, during peacetime and on operations.</p>&#13;\n        <p>\"It develops personal qualities that are key to success in any walk of life: leadership, judgement, determination, and physical stamina.\"</p>&#13;\n        <p>Later in January, the Army will announce the fourth round of its redundancy programme as the overall size of the regular force continues to be reduced.</p>&#13;\n        <p>January will also see the MoD launching a simplified online application form, a more streamlined medical clearance process and an army fitness app to make it easier for potential recruits to join.</p>&#13;\n  \n\n\t</div>\n  \n  </div></body></html>", "title": "Army launches \u00a33m recruitment drive", "updated": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 02:53:34 GMT", "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25688136#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "_id": 192353537, "source": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "text": "10 January 2014 Last updated at 21:53 ET Army launches \u00a33m recruitment drive The campaign has been dubbed 'More than meets the eye' The British army is launching a \u00a33m recruitment campaign aimed at boosting both the regular and reserve forces. As part of the drive, titled \"More than meets the eye\", television and cinema adverts will show how the Army Reserve is integrated with its counterpart. The Army is being cut from 100,000 troops to some 82,000, but the Ministry of Defence says it needs new recruits. It wants to increase the size of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to 30,000, but has failed to meet its targets so far. 'Challenge and adventure' Meanwhile, a poll commissioned by the Army to mark the campaign's launch suggested that 23% of people were not satisfied with their current career. When asked what was missing 30% said a decent salary; 27% said excellent training and personal development; 25% said a challenging and exciting role; 35% said UK and overseas travel; and 18% said getting paid while getting qualifications.

On Wednesday, the group published in both English and<a href=\"http://www.icij.org/project/zhong-guo-chi-jin-rong-jie-mi/ji-mi-dang-biao-ming-zhong-guo-shi-you-tan-wu-huo-yu-bi-shui\"> Chinese</a> its <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/offshore/chinas-scandal-torn-oil-industry-embraces-tax-havens\">second big story</a> on China, a case study of a former Chinese oil industry executive who set up dozens of shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands. The report also said that the leaked documents show China\u2019s three large state-owned oil companies \u2014 the biggest players in an industry rife with corruption \u2014 and executives at those enterprises set up dozens of offshore shell companies between 1995 and 2008.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The case study lays out how Sun Tiangang, the former executive, made a fortune as an entrepreneur in the oil industry before having his main company and its assets seized by former employees allied with powerful state interests. The reporters, Alexa Olesen and Michael Hudson, based their narrative on interviews with Mr. Sun and on a <a href=\"http://nebula.wsimg.com/955cfb43f1312ffb661d61a026276edd?AccessKeyId=2EE73AAF1C9284F03994&amp;disposition=0\">lawsuit</a> he filed last year in a United States district court in Los Angeles against Sinopec, one of the three giant Chinese state-owned oil enterprises and the fourth-biggest company in the world.<br/>\n<span id=\"more-5840\"/><br/>\nIn the lawsuit, Mr. Sun accused Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years, starting in 2005, and strip him of a company in the British Virgin Islands he had set up in connection to a profitable oil pipeline contract in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang. Even after Mr. Sun was released from jail in 2010, the lawsuit said, he was kept under a form of house arrest for two more years.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The lawsuit said Sinopec did not want to honor the 20-year contract and had built its own pipeline to move oil from the Tahe field in Xinjiang. Sinopec did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the reporters. Lawyers for the defendant have asked the U.S. court to dismiss the lawsuit because it is \u201ca quintessentially foreign dispute,\u201d according to a court filing. </p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mr. Sun\u2019s colorful tale brings into the spotlight many questionable practices common to business in China. One is the use of so-called <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/f-b-i-searches-offices-of-n-y-adviser-on-chinese-reverse-mergers/\">reverse mergers</a> to get Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges, but in a way that masks their identity and core business. This practice of backdoor listings has come under growing scrutiny by American officials. Mr. Sun got his oil pipeline joint venture onto the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by folding the British Virgin Islands company he had started, which was the majority shareholder in the oil pipeline business, into a food company that was listed on the exchange in 2001. Mr. Sun then changed the listed company\u2019s name to GeoMaxima Holdings and spun off the food business.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The article explained that this was a way around what Mr. Sun regarded as onerous restrictions. At the time, companies registered in the British Virgin Islands could not list in Hong Kong, nor could a mainland-registered company unless it had approval from officials in Beijing, which was difficult to secure.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The overview published on Tuesday of Chinese use of offshore shell companies said that there are legitimate reasons to set up such companies. The practice started becoming popular among Chinese businesspeople in the 1990s because the executives wanted, among other things, to get around strict capital controls and investment laws that favored foreign companies over domestic ones.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But there are more shadowy motivations too. The companies are tax shelters, and they can also hide the identities of important stakeholders. Mr. Sun said that setting up a company in the British Virgin Islands costs just a few hundred dollars and \u201cgives very strong cover\u201d by allowing the real owner to stay off stage.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Forty percent of offshore business in the British Virgin Islands comes from China and other Asian nations, the report said, citing officials in the islands. Among the clients are executives at the three Chinese oil giants: the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec; the China National Petroleum Corporation, or PetroChina; and the China National Offshore Oil Company, or Cnooc.

The first big China investigative story of the year has come from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which on Tuesday published, in tandem with several Western news organizations, a detailed look at the widespread use of offshore companies and tax havens by Chinese businesspeople and relatives of Communist Party leaders. The investigation into Chinese activity primarily in the British Virgin Islands originated with a trove of financial documents leaked to the consortium, a nonprofit group based in Washington. On Wednesday, the group published in both English and Chinese its second big story on China, a case study of a former Chinese oil industry executive who set up dozens of shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands. The report also said that the leaked documents show China\u2019s three large state-owned oil companies \u2014 the biggest players in an industry rife with corruption \u2014 and executives at those enterprises set up dozens of offshore shell companies between 1995 and 2008. The case study lays out how Sun Tiangang, the former executive, made a fortune as an entrepreneur in the oil industry before having his main company and its assets seized by former employees allied with powerful state interests. The reporters, Alexa Olesen and Michael Hudson, based their narrative on interviews with Mr. Sun and on a lawsuit he filed last year in a United States district court in Los Angeles against Sinopec, one of the three giant Chinese state-owned oil enterprises and the fourth-biggest company in the world. In the lawsuit, Mr. Sun accused Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years, starting in 2005, and strip him of a company in the British Virgin Islands he had set up in connection to a profitable oil pipeline contract in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang. Even after Mr. Sun was released from jail in 2010, the lawsuit said, he was kept under a form of house arrest for two more years. The lawsuit said Sinopec did not want to honor the 20-year contract and had built its own pipeline to move oil from the Tahe field in Xinjiang. Sinopec did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the reporters. Lawyers for the defendant have asked the U.S. court to dismiss the lawsuit because it is \u201ca quintessentially foreign dispute,\u201d according to a court filing. Mr. Sun\u2019s colorful tale brings into the spotlight many questionable practices common to business in China. One is the use of so-called reverse mergers to get Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges, but in a way that masks their identity and core business. This practice of backdoor listings has come under growing scrutiny by American officials. Mr. Sun got his oil pipeline joint venture onto the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by folding the British Virgin Islands company he had started, which was the majority shareholder in the oil pipeline business, into a food company that was listed on the exchange in 2001. Mr. Sun then changed the listed company\u2019s name to GeoMaxima Holdings and spun off the food business. The article explained that this was a way around what Mr. Sun regarded as onerous restrictions. At the time, companies registered in the British Virgin Islands could not list in Hong Kong, nor could a mainland-registered company unless it had approval from officials in Beijing, which was difficult to secure. The overview published on Tuesday of Chinese use of offshore shell companies said that there are legitimate reasons to set up such companies. The practice started becoming popular among Chinese businesspeople in the 1990s because the executives wanted, among other things, to get around strict capital controls and investment laws that favored foreign companies over domestic ones. But there are more shadowy motivations too. The companies are tax shelters, and they can also hide the identities of important stakeholders. Mr. Sun said that setting up a company in the British Virgin Islands costs just a few hundred dollars and \u201cgives very strong cover\u201d by allowing the real owner to stay off stage. Forty percent of offshore business in the British Virgin Islands comes from China and other Asian nations, the report said, citing officials in the islands. Among the clients are executives at the three Chinese oil giants: the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec; the China National Petroleum Corporation, or PetroChina; and the China National Offshore Oil Company, or Cnooc. The report said there were no signs of illegal activity by these executives or the oil enterprises, but the secretive nature of the offshore companies makes it difficult to pinpoint why the companies were set up. Executives at PetroChina have been detained as part of a wide-ranging corruption investigation by Communist Party officials. Party insiders say the main target of the investigation is Zhou Yongkang, the former member of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee who worked in the oil industry and, later, oversaw the domestic security agencies. Two smaller companies implicated in the PetroChina investigation have ties to offshore shell companies that show up in the leaked documents. Hua Bangsong, the founder of one of the two implicated companies, Wison Engineering Services, listed in Hong Kong, incorporated three Wison-related companies in the British Virgin Islands in 2003. Wison suspended its public trading in September and announced that Chinese officials had seized some books and records and had frozen some of its bank accounts as part of the investigation. It has said Mr. Hua is cooperating with officials. The other company implicated in the investigation that has links to a British Virgin Islands company is Zhongxu Investment Co.

Photograph: Reuters US cinema chain AMC has deemed that Google Glass, the eyewear that can record video and photography, is \"not appropriate\" for use in cinemas, following an incident in which homeland security officers interrogated a Glass wearer during a screening of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.Writing anonymously on The Gadgeteer blog, the man explained that halfway into the screening at an AMC in Columbus, Ohio, he was hauled out by police and officers from homeland security's ICE unit, which monitors piracy. \"A guy comes near my seat, shoves a badge that had some sort of a shield on it, yanks the Google Glass off my face and says 'Follow me outside immediately',\" said the man, who was taken into a room for interrogation. His Glass had been switched off during the movie, and he was wearing it for its prescription lenses.\"After a long time somebody came with a laptop and an USB cable at which point he told me it was my last chance to come clean. I repeated for the hundredth time there is nothing to come clean about and this is a big misunderstanding so the [ICE officer] finally connected my Glass to the computer, downloaded all my personal photos and started going though them one by one \u2026 Then they went through my phone, and five minutes later they concluded I had done nothing wrong.\" He wasn't apologised to, but was offered four free movie passes, which \"infuriated\" him.The ICE's Khaalid Walls confirmed the incident took place, and AMC responded with a statement: \"Movie theft is something we take very seriously, and our theatre managers contact the Motion Picture Association of America any time it's suspected that someone may be illegally recording content on screen.

And yet there I stood at the airport arrival gate in Chongqing, a city of 30 million people in southwestern China, holding a placard that carefully read \"Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal\" -- as if I might mistake this Shaquille O'Neal, the iconic NBA superstar that I grew up idolizing, with some <i>other </i>Shaquille O'Neal.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nA Chinese real estate company called MyTown had lured Shaq to Chongqing -- along with former NBA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Williams_(basketball,_born_1975)\">point guard</a> Jason \"White Chocolate\" Williams -- for a two-day publicity visit and exhibition game against a local Chinese professional team. The company had hired me to be Shaq's translator.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMy first instructions from the Chinese bosses were straightforward: 1) find Shaq when he got off the plane; 2) hand him a bouquet of roses so large that I could barely hold them. When Shaq arrived, his posse walking closely behind, I tried to present him with the portable garden I was carrying. \"You got a girlfriend?\" were his first words, asked in his famous, woofer-rattling monotone. \"No,\" I responded.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n\"Good. Then you'll need these more than I do.\"\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe main event was a basketball game in Chongqing's largest professional sports arena. I arrived early with Shaq and his crew, including his security chief, Jerome Cohen, and his agent, Perry Rogers. Together, we polished off six medium pizzas from Pizza Hut. <span class=\"pull-quote\">I did not see Shaq so much as sample a single Chinese dish during his visit, though he did repeatedly ask me if I could find him a restaurant that served dog.</span> Shaq's other odd requests included going to a hookah bar and finding high-quality, knock-off women's bags. (That said, he has a good poker face and I was never sure whether he was joking.)&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBefore the game started, I rebounded for Shaq as he heaved dozens of three-point shots. He only <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/614/shaquille-oneal\">hit one</a> three-pointer out of 22 attempts over a 19-year career, but somehow connected on roughly 50 percent of the three-pointers he took in Chongqing. His trick: yelling \"Danny Green\" -- channeling the young, San Antonio Spurs <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)\">sharp shooter</a> -- while releasing the ball.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe game itself was boring: A hodgepodge of American Division I college players and NBA washouts handily defeated the local Chongqing professional team, with Jason Williams dishing his signature behind-the-back, off-the-elbow passes and Shaq sitting on the sidelines in a crisp, quintuple extra-large white t-shirt, doing his best to resemble a coach. Despite not breaking a sweat, Shaq found himself the clear focus of the Chinese crowd. \"<i>Ao-ni-er, wo ai ni</i>!\" they cried. \"O'Neal, I love you!\"\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nAs the game wound down, one screaming fan's voice rose above the rest, carrying a pang of desperation. \"<i>Ao-ni-er! </i>Look at me! Look at me!\" I turned my head to locate the fan, who sat several rows behind the coaches, dressed in full Shaq regalia. Shaq himself also looked back. I was surprised to see a flicker of recognition in his eyes.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThat crazed fan's name is Wang \"Rashaun\" Liang -- the middle name is no coincidence. He was born in Anqiu, a small, obscure town in China's Shandong province, the son of a government worker and a nurse. He was passionate about basketball at an early age, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that the NBA made its first footprint in China, when new NBA commissioner David Stern -- in an early effort to increase the NBA's global reach -- offered to snail-mail one free NBA <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051ANPWO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=3909\">video segment</a> per week to be broadcast on CCTV, China's state-run television service. \"Everyone was obsessed with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, but <i>Ao-ni-er</i> caught my eye -- it was love at first sight,\" Wang told me at a Beijing caf\u00e9. \"Every week, I would wait for that game to be broadcast, crossing my fingers that I could see Shaq, my hero.\"&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBy the time Wang reached college in 2003, CCTV had started airing more games, and Wang sought to improve his English so that he could keep closer tabs on his idol. Despite being nearly broke during his senior year, Wang finagled a nosebleed seat to watch Shaq play in an exhibition game in Beijing, an experience that to this day makes him tremble with excitement. When he got his first job, Wang devoted entire paychecks to buying Shaq-related apparel, mostly jerseys and shoes. Today, he boasts a collection of 34 Shaq jerseys, many of them in the star's actual size, as well as a pair of Reebok sneakers -- size 23, U.S. -- once worn by Shaq himself. (Wang Liang is 5-foot-10 and weighs 170 pounds, about half of O'Neal's body weight.)\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIt should not come as a surprise that fans like Wang exist. Basketball has grown exponentially in China -- around 300 million Chinese people now\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nba.com/global/news/big_things_china_2012_02_03.html\">play</a>\u00a0it -- and Shaq, an adept marketer, has never been one to pass up the opportunity to sell himself. (With a straight face, he\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/19/sports/sports-of-the-times-shaq-is-now-california-dreamin.html\">once told</a>\u00a0reporters: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\") In 2006, late in his career, Shaq <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2550832\">landed</a> a lucrative endorsement deal from Lining, one of the largest Chinese sporting companies; during the 2008 Olympics, the company <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1677296-shaquille-oneal-and-kobe-bryant-have-incredible-statues-in-china\">erected</a> a 50-foot statue of the basketball superstar in a Beijing park.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n<span class=\"pull-quote\">Watching Shaq in action, it wasn't hard to understand why China has treated him so well.

And yet there I stood at the airport arrival gate in Chongqing, a city of 30 million people in southwestern China, holding a placard that carefully read \"Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal\" -- as if I might mistake this Shaquille O'Neal, the iconic NBA superstar that I grew up idolizing, with some other Shaquille O'Neal. A Chinese real estate company called MyTown had lured Shaq to Chongqing -- along with former NBA point guard Jason \"White Chocolate\" Williams -- for a two-day publicity visit and exhibition game against a local Chinese professional team. The company had hired me to be Shaq's translator. My first instructions from the Chinese bosses were straightforward: 1) find Shaq when he got off the plane; 2) hand him a bouquet of roses so large that I could barely hold them. When Shaq arrived, his posse walking closely behind, I tried to present him with the portable garden I was carrying. \"You got a girlfriend?\" were his first words, asked in his famous, woofer-rattling monotone. \"No,\" I responded. \"Good. Then you'll need these more than I do.\" The main event was a basketball game in Chongqing's largest professional sports arena. I arrived early with Shaq and his crew, including his security chief, Jerome Cohen, and his agent, Perry Rogers. Together, we polished off six medium pizzas from Pizza Hut. I did not see Shaq so much as sample a single Chinese dish during his visit, though he did repeatedly ask me if I could find him a restaurant that served dog. Shaq's other odd requests included going to a hookah bar and finding high-quality, knock-off women's bags. (That said, he has a good poker face and I was never sure whether he was joking.) Before the game started, I rebounded for Shaq as he heaved dozens of three-point shots. He only hit one three-pointer out of 22 attempts over a 19-year career, but somehow connected on roughly 50 percent of the three-pointers he took in Chongqing. His trick: yelling \"Danny Green\" -- channeling the young, San Antonio Spurs sharp shooter -- while releasing the ball. The game itself was boring: A hodgepodge of American Division I college players and NBA washouts handily defeated the local Chongqing professional team, with Jason Williams dishing his signature behind-the-back, off-the-elbow passes and Shaq sitting on the sidelines in a crisp, quintuple extra-large white t-shirt, doing his best to resemble a coach. Despite not breaking a sweat, Shaq found himself the clear focus of the Chinese crowd. \"Ao-ni-er, wo ai ni!\" they cried. \"O'Neal, I love you!\" As the game wound down, one screaming fan's voice rose above the rest, carrying a pang of desperation. \"Ao-ni-er! Look at me! Look at me!\" I turned my head to locate the fan, who sat several rows behind the coaches, dressed in full Shaq regalia. Shaq himself also looked back. I was surprised to see a flicker of recognition in his eyes. That crazed fan's name is Wang \"Rashaun\" Liang -- the middle name is no coincidence. He was born in Anqiu, a small, obscure town in China's Shandong province, the son of a government worker and a nurse. He was passionate about basketball at an early age, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that the NBA made its first footprint in China, when new NBA commissioner David Stern -- in an early effort to increase the NBA's global reach -- offered to snail-mail one free NBA video segment per week to be broadcast on CCTV, China's state-run television service. \"Everyone was obsessed with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, but Ao-ni-er caught my eye -- it was love at first sight,\" Wang told me at a Beijing caf\u00e9. \"Every week, I would wait for that game to be broadcast, crossing my fingers that I could see Shaq, my hero.\" By the time Wang reached college in 2003, CCTV had started airing more games, and Wang sought to improve his English so that he could keep closer tabs on his idol. Despite being nearly broke during his senior year, Wang finagled a nosebleed seat to watch Shaq play in an exhibition game in Beijing, an experience that to this day makes him tremble with excitement. When he got his first job, Wang devoted entire paychecks to buying Shaq-related apparel, mostly jerseys and shoes. Today, he boasts a collection of 34 Shaq jerseys, many of them in the star's actual size, as well as a pair of Reebok sneakers -- size 23, U.S. -- once worn by Shaq himself. (Wang Liang is 5-foot-10 and weighs 170 pounds, about half of O'Neal's body weight.) It should not come as a surprise that fans like Wang exist. Basketball has grown exponentially in China -- around 300 million Chinese people now play it -- and Shaq, an adept marketer, has never been one to pass up the opportunity to sell himself. (With a straight face, he once told reporters: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\") In 2006, late in his career, Shaq landed a lucrative endorsement deal from Lining, one of the largest Chinese sporting companies; during the 2008 Olympics, the company erected a 50-foot statue of the basketball superstar in a Beijing park. Watching Shaq in action, it wasn't hard to understand why China has treated him so well. He seemed to have the country down to a science: With his expressive body language and infectious charm, it was as if he barely needed my services as translator. He knew exactly when to sign basketballs, whose hand to shake, and whom to flatter. He even grasped some basic Mandarin, rattling off phrases to his fawning fans. Chinese fans often invent their own, alternative nicknames for favorite NBA players. For example, former San Antonio Spurs center Tim Duncan, renowned for his stoic game-time demeanor, is called shifou, or \"Stone Buddha.\" Besides Ao-ni-er, which is simply a phonetic translation of his last name, Shaq has two other popular Chinese monikers: Da-sha-yu, or \"Big Shark,\" and Ao-pang, which roughly translates as \"O'Fatty.\" I told Shaq about his first two nicknames (diplomatically withholding the third), and within minutes he was mouthing his Chinese name to himself, trying to remember it. \"Yo, Perry!\" he yelled across a room to his sports agent. \"You know they call me 'Big Shark' here?\" After shouting himself hoarse at the Chongqing basketball game, Wang Liang finally got his wish: He met the Big Shark.

But the campaign against ISIS (also sometimes known as ISIL) appears to demonstrate improved coordination and unity among leading rebel groups, which could make them a more formidable fighting force when their full attention shifts back to the regime.

That might not sound like revolutionary behavior -- but it may have been enough to convince the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that Xu constituted a clear and present danger to its authority.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSince Xu was <a href=\"http://www.cecc.gov/publications/commission-analysis/xu-zhiyong-tried-for-advocacy-of-education-equality-and-official\">detained</a> in July 2013, his case has received extensive international media coverage. In the majority of reports, Xu is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/world/asia/chinese-activists-test-new-leader-and-are-crushed.html?emc=edit_tnt_20140115&amp;tntemail0=y\">described</a><b> </b>as a \"legal scholar,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/01/the-trial-of-the-chinese-dream.html?mobify=0;\">\"legal activist,\"</a> \"rights advocate,\" or \"rights lawyer\" -- not a \"dissident.\" That may be because Xu has always insisted that he is a \"peaceful reformer\" who does not espouse radical action to bring about rapid political and social change. As Xu <a href=\"/%22http:\">emphasized</a> in his final statement in court, he and fellow rights advocates have been \"moderate and reasonable\" in their approach. In demanding asset disclosure by officials, for instance, they avoided organizing large crowds, <a href=\"http://chinachange.org/2014/01/23/for-freedom-justice-and-love-my-closing-statement-to-the-court/\">choosing</a> instead flash mob-style actions that only involved a small number of participants, as they <a href=\"http://chinachange.org/2014/01/23/for-freedom-justice-and-love-my-closing-statement-to-the-court/\">believe</a> that \"reform requires stability and social progress needs to advance gradually.\"\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBut despite Xu's efforts, it is hard to imagine that the Chinese authorities view him as anything other than a diehard dissident. <span class=\"pull-quote\">Some well-connected Beijingers believe that party leaders think Xu and his fellow activists in the New Citizens Movement had formed an \"anti-CCP clique\" -- a very serious charge.\u00a0</span> and have decided they therefore do not deserve lenient treatment.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIf this rumor is true, it should not surprise anybody with basic knowledge of the rules of the Chinese political game. Chinese civil society actors have long known there are three red lines they mustn't cross if they don't want to end up on Beijing's list of troublemakers. The first is between the political and the non-political: If the issues they engage with are political in nature, civil society actors must find ways to depoliticize them and present them as technical issues instead. The second line is between national and local: Any attempt to establish cross-regional organizations or movements must be strictly avoided. Everything must be kept localized and uncoordinated with activities in other locations. The third is street campaigns. Criticizing the authorities in conference rooms, advocacy reports, or on the web is one thing. Once critics take to the street, it's a different ballgame.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nStaying away from these red lines doesn't guarantee that civil society activities will be free from government intervention or harassment. But the consequences of crossing them is usually much worse. Xu and his fellow campaigners stepped beyond all three.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn his May 2012 <a href=\"http://chinachange.org/2014/01/19/the-new-citizens-movement-trials/\">essay</a> \"New Citizens' Movement,\" Xu was clear about the movement's true nature. The essay's opening line calls it \"a political movement,\" one where \"this ancient nation bids utter farewell to authoritarianism and completes the civilized transformation to constitutional governance.\" Xu called on Chinese citizens all over the country to participate in the movement by organizing regular meals to meet like-minded people living in the same cities to discuss the current political situation. \"Every place has a group of modern citizens. Everybody needs to group together for society to progress. Unity begins with acquaintance,\" the essay read. The campaign has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/world/asia/chinese-activists-test-new-leader-and-are-crushed.html?emc=edit_tnt_20140115&amp;tntemail0=y\">reportedly</a> attracted 5,000 supporters across China. So much for the first two red lines.\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nXu and his friends refrained from mobilizing large-scale street rallies -- but they did organize activities in public venues, which facilitated the criminal charge of \"disrupting order in public places,\" justified or not. That stepped beyond the third unspoken line the Communist Party has drawn in the sand.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMaking things worse in the eyes of party authorities, movement advocates campaigned on the issue of asset transparency of government officials, one that resonates deeply with the Chinese public, as rampant corruption fans\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/11/08/inflation-corruption-inequality-top-list-of-chinese-publics-concerns/\">mounting</a>\u00a0anger. The authorities may think that Xu and other members deliberately made this issue the centerpiece of their campaign, in an effort to gain maximum popularity for their movement and cause maximum embarrassment to the party.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn short, <span class=\"pull-quote\">Xu may be a moderate in his own estimate, but he and fellow activists almost certainly knew the party would see them as mounting a direct challenge to the existing political system.</span> Those who know Xu have not accused him of na\u00efvet\u00e9, so observers have offered various speculations as to what prompted him to stride across the party's tripwires. Some international media reports have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/world/asia/chinese-activists-test-new-le\">suggested</a> that after China's new leaders took office in late 2012, promising to deepen reform, attack corruption, and promote the rule of law, Xu and other members of the movement became emboldened and decided to test the new leadership's tolerance for grassroots political activism. If indeed they felt the time was ripe for a courageous move, they were also surely aware of the great risks it entailed.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe sentencing of Xu -- and the crushing of the New Citizens Movement that it represents -- does not necessarily mean that the new leadership will not contemplate any political reform. But the party will not allow any outside force to dictate reform's timing, pace, or agenda; if reform happens, it will be from the top down. The party is convinced that the day that grassroots political movements born without party blessing can flourish is the day when it loses full control of the country's political process. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"image_credit\">Getty Images</p>\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t    </div></body></html>", "title": "Clique-Bait", "updated": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 16:01:20 +0000", "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/27/clique_bait_xu_zhiyong_anti_CCP_rumors", "_id": 222563033, "source": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/node/feed", "text": "On Jan. 22, Xu Zhiyong, co-founder of the New Citizens' Movement, went on trial in a Beijing court on the charge of \"assembling a crowd to disrupt order in a public place\"; on Jan. 26, he was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison.

As Xu emphasized in his final statement in court, he and fellow rights advocates have been \"moderate and reasonable\" in their approach. In demanding asset disclosure by officials, for instance, they avoided organizing large crowds, choosing instead flash mob-style actions that only involved a small number of participants, as they believe that \"reform requires stability and social progress needs to advance gradually.\" But despite Xu's efforts, it is hard to imagine that the Chinese authorities view him as anything other than a diehard dissident. Some well-connected Beijingers believe that party leaders think Xu and his fellow activists in the New Citizens Movement had formed an \"anti-CCP clique\" -- a very serious charge. and have decided they therefore do not deserve lenient treatment. If this rumor is true, it should not surprise anybody with basic knowledge of the rules of the Chinese political game. Chinese civil society actors have long known there are three red lines they mustn't cross if they don't want to end up on Beijing's list of troublemakers. The first is between the political and the non-political: If the issues they engage with are political in nature, civil society actors must find ways to depoliticize them and present them as technical issues instead. The second line is between national and local: Any attempt to establish cross-regional organizations or movements must be strictly avoided. Everything must be kept localized and uncoordinated with activities in other locations. The third is street campaigns. Criticizing the authorities in conference rooms, advocacy reports, or on the web is one thing. Once critics take to the street, it's a different ballgame. Staying away from these red lines doesn't guarantee that civil society activities will be free from government intervention or harassment. But the consequences of crossing them is usually much worse. Xu and his fellow campaigners stepped beyond all three. In his May 2012 essay \"New Citizens' Movement,\" Xu was clear about the movement's true nature. The essay's opening line calls it \"a political movement,\" one where \"this ancient nation bids utter farewell to authoritarianism and completes the civilized transformation to constitutional governance.\" Xu called on Chinese citizens all over the country to participate in the movement by organizing regular meals to meet like-minded people living in the same cities to discuss the current political situation. \"Every place has a group of modern citizens. Everybody needs to group together for society to progress. Unity begins with acquaintance,\" the essay read. The campaign has reportedly attracted 5,000 supporters across China. So much for the first two red lines. Xu and his friends refrained from mobilizing large-scale street rallies -- but they did organize activities in public venues, which facilitated the criminal charge of \"disrupting order in public places,\" justified or not. That stepped beyond the third unspoken line the Communist Party has drawn in the sand. Making things worse in the eyes of party authorities, movement advocates campaigned on the issue of asset transparency of government officials, one that resonates deeply with the Chinese public, as rampant corruption fans mounting anger. The authorities may think that Xu and other members deliberately made this issue the centerpiece of their campaign, in an effort to gain maximum popularity for their movement and cause maximum embarrassment to the party. In short, Xu may be a moderate in his own estimate, but he and fellow activists almost certainly knew the party would see them as mounting a direct challenge to the existing political system. Those who know Xu have not accused him of na\u00efvet\u00e9, so observers have offered various speculations as to what prompted him to stride across the party's tripwires. Some international media reports have suggested that after China's new leaders took office in late 2012, promising to deepen reform, attack corruption, and promote the rule of law, Xu and other members of the movement became emboldened and decided to test the new leadership's tolerance for grassroots political activism. If indeed they felt the time was ripe for a courageous move, they were also surely aware of the great risks it entailed. The sentencing of Xu -- and the crushing of the New Citizens Movement that it represents -- does not necessarily mean that the new leadership will not contemplate any political reform. But the party will not allow any outside force to dictate reform's timing, pace, or agenda; if reform happens, it will be from the top down. The party is convinced that the day that grassroots political movements born without party blessing can flourish is the day when it loses full control of the country's political process.

Asked how he rated the chances that the talks would last through the day, the diplomat cast his eyes toward the ceiling for a long moment. \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance,\u201d he said. Lakhdar Brahimi, the international mediator in the Syrian peace talks, with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday in Montreux. Gary Cameron/Reuters The rockiness that characterized the opening statements on Wednesday in Montreux was still apparent in the wrangling over details. No flags will be displayed, since each side abhors the other\u2019s banner.\u201cThe parties agreed that it is too early. There is no common ground at all,\u201d said Louay Safi, a spokesman for the Syrian exile coalition. Ahmad Assi al-Jarba, the president of the coalition, will not be on the opposition\u2019s negotiating team. No one would say why he would not participate, but the government holds him in particular contempt, and there was speculation that his absence was a government demand.Mr. Jarba, at an evening news conference, said it was not important for him to be in the room personally, and that the delegation attending would be fully empowered by him to negotiate on the coalition\u2019s behalf \u2014 a statement that was progress for an opposition coalition long criticized as deeply divided, full of competing egos and unable to work for a common goal. The government said it was committed to continuing the talks and that even a transition could be discussed \u2014 once \u201cthe issue of terrorism is addressed.\u201d From its early moments on Wednesday, the conference on Syria was marked by acrimony, when Syria\u2019s foreign minister described Syrian rebels as \u201cevil\u201d and ignored appeals by Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, to avoid invective or even to yield the floor.By the end of the day, the sense that the talks were headed for trouble was compounded when the proceedings ended without any hint of progress toward imposing local cease-fires or opening humanitarian corridors for the delivery of food and medicine to besieged towns and cities.The government, for its part, insisted it was committed to continuing the talks.\u201cNo way we shall leave the room, absolutely,\u201d Fayssal Mekdad, the deputy foreign minister, said in an interview. \u201cEven if nobody else is left.\u201d \u201cWe have to agree on a formula where all terrorist organizations should be fought by all Syrians and be expelled,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who are financing, supporting, arming and harboring terrorists should be made accountable.\u201dWhile no one disputes that extremist Islamist militant groups have taken root in rebel-held Syria or that foreign donors have sustained them, the government has typically referred to all its opponents as terrorists. And while the Geneva I accords, the basis for the current talks, call for foreign states to stop financing militias in Syria, the government insists that does not include its support from Iran and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah.Diplomats found hope in common language used by the government and the opposition. Both sides, over the past two days, have declared that the Geneva I accords are \u201ca single package\u201d or \u201ca basket\u201d \u2014 that is, none of the goals they set out can be discussed in isolation, including a transitional government, humanitarian aid and an end to violence. While the opposition focuses on a transitional government, and the government focuses on \u201cfighting terrorism,\u201d both of those goals fall within the Geneva I package.Wednesday\u2019s opening statements in Montreux were characterized by harsh accusations and hard-line positions.But the Western diplomat noted that the Syrian government position seemed to moderate over the course of the day, particularly after an inflammatory opening speech by the foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, met with nearly unanimous disapproval.The diplomat said it was possible that the Russians, the Syrians\u2019 most powerful ally, had urged them to rein in their language. Mr. Moallem did not appear at a news conference Wednesday night; instead, the smoother Bashar Jaafari, Syria\u2019s representative to the United Nations in New York, did. Mr. Jaafari, the diplomat noted, stated that the Syrians were \u201chere to implement Geneva I,\u201d something the foreign minister has not conceded. In between, representatives of 40 countries had taken the podium. And all, even China, Russia, India and other countries the Syrian government considers sympathetic, had emphasized the importance of adhering to Geneva I, including its goal of a transitional government chosen by \u201cmutual consent.\u201d \u201cThe regime heard the message,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTo stick with what Moallem said will leave Syria completely isolated.\u201d Iran, Syria\u2019s closest ally, has declined to endorse Geneva I, which resulted in its invitation being rescinded. Mr. Mekdad called this an American plot to stack the conference with \u201canti-Syrian\u201d countries. Asked if there were 40 countries in the world that support the Syrian government, he said \u201cabsolutely,\u201d but did not list them.At Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, called for free and fair elections in Syria, part of a speech generally regarded as conciliatory to the West. For its part, the opposition coalition needs to be seen as delivering something after its decision, controversial among its base, to attend the talks, Western diplomats said. That means staying and talking. On Thursday, Mr. Jarba said the coalition\u2019s top priority remained Mr. Assad\u2019s departure. But afterward, his chief of staff said that the immediate priorities were to talk about humanitarian access, cease-fires and prisoner exchanges, the confidence-building measures that the United States and Russia hope could build momentum for the political process.Coalition members and their supporters were riding high, feeling that they had come across as the more statesmanlike of the two parties.\u201cOne thing they\u2019ve gotten good at is going to conferences,\u201d joked Adnan Hadad, an opposition activist from Aleppo attending the meeting as a journalist, a dig at the coalition members\u2019 frequent stays in hotels trying to shore up international support and iron out internal differences.

Oliver White and the Rev. Lisa Bodenheim. Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times SOUTH ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Three below zero on a Minnesota morning, and the Rev. Oliver White stomps the snow off his boots as he enters the stucco edifice of Clark Memorial United Church of Christ to lead worship. He peels off an overcoat to reveal the kente-cloth vestments his wife made for him, which match the kufi hat he wears.On this Sunday midway between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day, he sees a congregation thinned by both vacation and weather. Perhaps 50 people fill the pews, yet in their modest number resides a startling range: a lesbian couple with their son; a 98-year-old man who still shovels his own sidewalk; the black and white relatives of a biracial baby about to be baptized.\u201cGood morning, and let\u2019s have the church say, \u2018Amen,\u2019 \u201c Mr. White, 71, begins, standing in the aisle rather than at the pulpit. Hearing the desultory response, he chides: \u201cThat was only half the church. Again?\u201d The voices now rise, and he adds his own emphatic \u201cAmen!\u201dSuch are the sights and sounds of redemption. In this unassuming sanctuary in a middle-class neighborhood, in this congregation stitched together from two struggling flocks, Mr. White is doing something that he had just about given up hope of ever doing again. He is pastoring. The Rev. Oliver White with parishioners.

In it, Wen asserts that \"I have never and would never abuse my power for personal gain.\" At the missive's end, Wen writes that he longs to \"put a good end to the last leg of my life's journey\" and concludes with a flourish: \"I came to this world naked, and will leave clean.\"<b> \u00a0</b>\u00a0&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nPerhaps not coincidentally, two days later, <i>People's Daily</i> online, a Communist Party outlet, published a\u00a0<a href=\"http://hebei.ifeng.com/news/detail_2014_01/20/1761501_0.shtml\">feature</a>\u00a0on Wen's family, and depicted Wen as coming from a long line of earnest and humble educators -- his father was a teacher.

Despite the immense prestige afforded to the person who was China's second most powerful official for 10 years, Wen has found himself and his family put under a microscope in the waning days of his public life. His family was twice the target of New York Times investigative reports: An October 2012 Pulitzer Prize-winning article alleged that his family had accumulated at least $2.7 billion dollars. (In Oct. 2012, lawyers representing Wen's family reportedly called the story \"untrue\" and threatened legal action.) A November 2013 follow-up in the same publication then alleged financial dealings between Wen's daughter Wen Ruchun and J.P. Morgan, the U.S. investment bank. (J.P. Morgan has declined to comment to the New York Times on the allegations, but in the wake of investigations was recently reported to have removed itself from a major potential investment in a Chinese chemical company.) And in mid-January, an article in British newspaper The Guardian reported that Wen, in addition to other high Chinese officials, had family members who stored wealth in offshore financial entities. None of the articles implicated Wen himself, but the descriptions of nepotism and corruption have painted Wen and his family in a particularly unflattering light. Then, Wen struck back -- sort of.

Given the political connections of the People's Daily, the feature was likely calculated to complement the publication of Wen's letter. Indeed, the release of Wen's handwritten response may be deliberately timed to quash rumors and vouch for his good name at a time when president Xi Jinping has stepped up his anti-corruption crackdown, vowing to snare both minor and major officials in its dragnet. Wen has not faced any allegations in domestic media following the New York Times expos\u00e9s, but he might still be concerned about his fate given that Zhou Yongkang, the former security czar, is reportedly under secret investigation for corruption.

Mr. Daschle spoke for the Democrats in 2004, after Mr. Bush, and lost his seat nine months later.

Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 The protocol is staid and formulaic. The president addresses Congress on the State of the Union, then the opposition party\u2019s designee follows with a reply. The choreography is tight, predictable and usually forgettable.Not this year. The response, a once careful attempt at stagecraft fashioned under the close watch of party chiefs to be as uniform and on message as possible, has given way to political free agency. The shift speaks volumes about politics today: the value placed on the individual brand over the larger organization, and the way social media and technology have torn down barriers to fame and influence. For example, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, plans to spend part of Tuesday in a television studio off Capitol Hill recording his own unsanctioned rebuttal to Mr. Obama\u2019s address that night. His staff plans to blast the video to news outlets around the world, and to the hundreds of thousands of people the senator reaches online through Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. Senators Mike Lee of Utah, left, and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Lee will speak for the Tea Party; Mr. Cruz issued an early statement. Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, will have top billing for the newest \u2014 and to some Republicans the most unwelcome \u2014 post-State of the Union event, the official Tea Party response.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, not content to wait until Tuesday, got rolling last week when he released a statement in which he demanded that Mr. Obama answer accusations on a variety of issues, including National Security Agency surveillance and the Affordable Care Act. He then followed up with a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asking for a special prosecutor to look into accusations of political persecution by the Internal Revenue Service.Competing with them for the soapbox will be Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, who is to deliver the party\u2019s official response.\u201cThere is no clear leadership in the Republican Party right now, no clear direction or message, and no way to enforce discipline,\u201d said Mark McKinnon, a veteran Republican strategist who has become an outspoken critic of his party. \u201cAnd because there\u2019s a vacuum, and no shortage of cameras, there are plenty of actors happy to audition.\u201dThe Republican leadership in Congress is trying not to cede control to its freelance responders. In an effort led by Ms. McMorris Rodgers, members shuffling out of the House chamber after Mr. Obama\u2019s address will be steered toward one of several rapid-response booths, which will bear a Republican slogan and be stocked with iPads and other devices to allow them to record six-second videos through Vine.Republican officials said members were being encouraged to focus on pushing back on Democratic claims that the Republican-controlled House has offered little of an agenda of its own other than to oppose the president.But amid all the jockeying for who can have the best, loudest and most effective retort on Tuesday, many Republicans and Democrats who have been through this before are asking, Why bother? The response is a risky endeavor, often marred by inelegance and blunder.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a good one,\u201d said John Feehery, who was an aide to J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican and a former House speaker. \u201cThere\u2019s this element of getting too close to the sun. They think they\u2019re hot stuff, and their hot stuff gets melted in the glare of the lights. It\u2019s very risky.\u201dYou can get embarrassingly thirsty, as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida did last year when he ducked down about 11 minutes into his remarks to take a sip from a bottle of water. You can look at the wrong camera, as Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota did in 2011 when she delivered the first Tea Party response. Or you can have an awkward stroll to the camera, as Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana did in 2009 when he gave the Republican Party\u2019s reply to a major economic policy address that Mr. Obama delivered shortly after he was inaugurated.There are many reasons it so often goes awry. The speaker always looks diminished next to the president, whose appearance inside the vast House chamber seems so majestic as members of Congress shower him with standing ovation after standing ovation. The response is usually delivered from an unfamiliar location somewhere in the Capitol, underscoring a sense of isolation. \u201cYou\u2019re always cognizant of what an imbalance in setting it is,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the Senate, who gave his party\u2019s response to some of President George W. Bush\u2019s speeches. \u201cAny time you can have an audience that stands and applauds at virtually every sentence, it\u2019s an enormous disadvantage to have to speak to a camera by yourself afterwards.\u201dResponse speeches, whether to the State of the Union or any other major presidential address, are almost always canned, with most of the text written before the opposing party has had a chance to read or hear the president\u2019s remarks.For those who agree to give the speech after the State of the Union address, it can be a career kiss of death, the political world\u2019s equivalent of the Sports Illustrated cover curse. Mr. Daschle spoke for the Democrats in 2004, after Mr. Bush, and lost his seat nine months later. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas delivered the Republican response in 1996 only to lose that year\u2019s presidential race to Bill Clinton. Others have met a more ignominious fate. Bob McDonnell, who was indicted last week on federal corruption charges, delivered the Republican message in 2010 as governor of Virginia. The practice of answering a president\u2019s State of the Union address as the opposition party does today on broadcast television began in 1982, when Democrats produced a documentary-style program with ordinary citizens and members of Congress sounding off on the Reagan presidency. They stuck to this format for a few years, and one year featured a rising star who was a young, telegenic governor from Arkansas named Bill Clinton.But back then there was no Twitter, no Vine and no Tea Party.\u201cThe message development for the party and on Capitol Hill has been flipped,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and a former aide to Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. \u201cIt used to be that congressional leadership could develop the broad outline of the party\u2019s message, and everyone else could echo it. We\u2019re no longer in a place where members are echoing leadership. They\u2019re competing with leadership.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 27, 2014, on page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Some Republicans Departing From Response Script.

But there is a high degree of resistance in all strata of Ukrainian society, particularly among the youth.\"Barely two weeks ago, the protests appeared to be petering out amid bitter winter cold and news that Russian President Vladimir Putin had relieved Ukraine's desperate financial problems by granting Mr. Yanukovych a cash loan of $15 billion.But the ham-handed anti-protest law passed by a narrow pro-Yanukovych majority in the parliament, which goes against Ukraine's political traditions, appears to have reinvigorated protests on the Maidan, which swelled to over 100,000 people on Sunday. \"This is a battle for democracy. Ukrainian citizens are demanding that the authorities listen,\" says Olga Bodnar, an opposition parliamentary deputy. \"Unfortunately, two people are dead. Real bullets are flying now.\"Sergei Strokan, foreign affairs columnist with the Moscow daily Kommersant, says that the consequences of the violence \u2013 whoever may be provoking it \u2013 may be catastrophic.\"There has always been a consensus, across Ukraine's political spectrum, that a Ukrainian quarrel is different from a Syrian, or even a Russian one. After all, this is a country that went through the 'Orange Revolution' in 2004, without a single instance of violence,\" he says.\"There are now different agendas in play. The opposition has split between moderates and radicals, and the radicals are already rejecting the authority of moderate opposition leaders such as Vitali Klitschko, Yuri Lutsenko, and Arseny Yatsenyuk,\" Mr. Strokan says. \"The moderates might be willing to hammer out a deal with Yanukovych, especially if it would lead to early elections. The radicals are apparently not interested at all in talking with the government, or compromising with it, but want to overthrow it. Yanukovych would like to restore order, but he no longer has any idea how to do this. This situation is fraught with danger.\"Some experts say the violence is increasing public support for the radicals, and the longer it goes on, the greater the danger that Ukraine's delicate political balance will be permanently destabilized.\"Both sides are attacking each other now. The police are using firearms and rubber bullets, including some kinds of weapons that are prohibited in Ukraine. The radicals are using Molotov cocktails and paving stones. They just go on battering each other,\" says Alexander Chekmishev, deputy director of the journalism department at Kiev State University. \"The authorities refuse to make any compromises. They talk about wanting dialogue, but they don't actually agree to do it.\"Mr. Chekmishev adds that the potential for lethal violence in Kiev is high, thanks to a prevalence of guns. \"Bear in mind that there are lots of firearms in Kiev in private hands; there are probably about 8 private guns for every Berkut [riot unit] policeman,\" he says.Mikhail Pogrebinsky, director of the independent Kiev Center of Political and Conflict Studies, says the radicals are now driving events.\"The opposition is now effectively calling on everyone to come out and take part in the revolution. The leaders on the Maidan are now actually solidarizing with the most aggressive radicals who go out and physically attack the police, and then they blame the authorities for whatever happens,\" he says. \"There is no space for dialogue under circumstances like these.\"", "published": "", "tags": null}, {"author": "By MICHAEL WILSON", "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">In Rhino Horn Case, Judge Sees a Criminal Instead of a \u2018Na\u00efve Kid\u2019 </h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n            \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"340\" data-total-count=\"340\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Michael Slattery Jr. stood in court with his hands clenched behind him as if they were still in the shackles that had just been removed.

Three weeks ago, on Dec. 21, a state-run newspaper,&#13;\nthe <i>Mirror</i>, surprised readers by&#13;\ndevoting almost its entire front page to four separate stories on the most&#13;\nrecent activities of the commander-in-chief.

Particularly striking is the fact that the military&#13;\nstrongman used the phrase \"human security\" in English. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nSo what's going on? Can we learn anything useful from&#13;\nreading between the lines here? In fact, that there are at least two important conclusions&#13;\nwe can draw from Min Aung Hlaing's speeches. First, his remarks signal an&#13;\nimportant shift in the development of military doctrine, one that entails a&#13;\nmajor change in the style of the leadership of the armed forces. Second, his&#13;\nstatements strongly suggest that the commander-in-chief is considering the possibility&#13;\nof entering politics, perhaps by running for president in the next national&#13;\nelection scheduled for 2015.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nOver the past 25 years, since the military seized&#13;\npower in 1988, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_Armed_Forces\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Tatmadaw</i></a> (armed&#13;\nforces) has professed to follow an ideology based on \"Three National&#13;\nPrinciples\" -- namely, the preservation of the union, the maintenance of&#13;\nnational solidarity, and the defense of sovereignty. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nBased on these principles, the armed forces developed a&#13;\ndoctrine they called \"total national defense,\" which is included in Burma's 2008&#13;\nconstitution. This was the third phase of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Building-Tatmadaw-Myanmar-Armed-Forces/dp/9812308482/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388031436&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=building+tatmadaw+aung+myoe\" target=\"_blank\">doctrinal development</a> in the recent history of the armed forces. The Tatmadaw announced its&#13;\nfirst official doctrine in 1950, followed by a second in 1958. While some of&#13;\nthe details have changed, the ideological program articulated in all three&#13;\ncases revolves around the notion of state security. As experience has shown,&#13;\nthe armed forces take these statements of doctrine very seriously. In the past,&#13;\neven when these ideological guidelines were kept secret from the public (right&#13;\nup into the 1990s), the armed forces nonetheless used them as the basis for&#13;\ncivil-military relations and its interventions in civil politics. In the&#13;\ndoctrine developed in the late 1950s, for instance, the Tatmadaw expanded its&#13;\nrole from defense to public administration and business. The military then&#13;\nproceeded to put these principles into practice, seizing state power for two&#13;\nyears starting in 1958 and establishing military conglomerates in late 1950s. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe military staged its coups in 1958, 1962, and 1988&#13;\nin the name of state security -- the same rationale cited by the successive&#13;\njuntas to justify economic autarky and self-imposed isolation in foreign&#13;\npolicy. The coup leaders continued to cite state security needs to legitimize&#13;\ntheir expansion of the army at the expense of education, economic welfare, and&#13;\nhealth care. The military built roads, bridges, dams, and even a new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naypyidaw\" target=\"_blank\">capital</a> deep in the jungle. <span class=\"pull-quote\">The former military leaders I've&#13;\ninterviewed in the course of my studies placed supreme emphasis on state&#13;\nsecurity, despite their clear awareness that the public has entirely different&#13;\npriorities, such as democracy and social welfare.</span> Members of the military&#13;\ndismiss such views as \"populist\" or \"short-sighted.\"&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn this historical context, Min Aung Hlaing's explicit&#13;\nembrace of \"human security\" represents a dramatic departure from the norm. If&#13;\nhis statements are to be taken seriously, they indicate an attempt by the&#13;\nmilitary to win the people's hearts and minds by re-defining the armed forces&#13;\nas the defenders of democracy and social welfare.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nAnd what about the possibility that the&#13;\ncommander-in-chief is positioning himself for the 2015 elections? According to&#13;\nseveral sources inside the military, Min Aung Hlaing, who will reach retirement&#13;\nage that same year, is quietly preparing a run for the presidency. Some of Burma's&#13;\nmilitary lawmakers have <a href=\"http://www.irrawaddy.org/min-aung-hlaing/military-mp-says-army-chief-become-candidate-president.html\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> that the armed&#13;\nforces will nominate Min Aung Hlaing as a presidential candidate in 2015. If this&#13;\nis the case, Min Aung Hlaing's \"human security\" rhetoric might well resonate&#13;\nwith the public's aspiration, and he could present himself as a statesman with&#13;\na clear political vision, perhaps enabling him to profit from <a href=\"http://transitions.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/10/a_state_of_anxiety#sthash.CN7HFJ1u.dpbs\" target=\"_blank\">intense personal rivalries</a> among the other contenders, including the incumbent president Thein&#13;\nSein, the parliamentary speaker Thura Shwe Mann, and opposition leader Aung San&#13;\nSuu Kyi.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nIn any event, it's quite clear that observers of&#13;\nBurma's political scene will find themselves paying even closer attention to&#13;\nthe doings of Min Aung Hlaing in the months to come. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"image_credit\">PRAKASH SINGH/AFP/GettyImages</p>\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t    </div></body></html>", "title": "The Man to Watch - By Su Mon Thazin Aung", "updated": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 20:26:56 +0000", "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/15/the_man_to_watch", "_id": 258347985, "source": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/node/feed", "text": "People in Burma are accustomed to keeping a close eye on their generals.

As experience has shown, the armed forces take these statements of doctrine very seriously. In the past, even when these ideological guidelines were kept secret from the public (right up into the 1990s), the armed forces nonetheless used them as the basis for civil-military relations and its interventions in civil politics. In the doctrine developed in the late 1950s, for instance, the Tatmadaw expanded its role from defense to public administration and business. The military then proceeded to put these principles into practice, seizing state power for two years starting in 1958 and establishing military conglomerates in late 1950s. The military staged its coups in 1958, 1962, and 1988 in the name of state security -- the same rationale cited by the successive juntas to justify economic autarky and self-imposed isolation in foreign policy. The coup leaders continued to cite state security needs to legitimize their expansion of the army at the expense of education, economic welfare, and health care. The military built roads, bridges, dams, and even a new capital deep in the jungle. The former military leaders I've interviewed in the course of my studies placed supreme emphasis on state security, despite their clear awareness that the public has entirely different priorities, such as democracy and social welfare. Members of the military dismiss such views as \"populist\" or \"short-sighted.\" In this historical context, Min Aung Hlaing's explicit embrace of \"human security\" represents a dramatic departure from the norm. If his statements are to be taken seriously, they indicate an attempt by the military to win the people's hearts and minds by re-defining the armed forces as the defenders of democracy and social welfare. And what about the possibility that the commander-in-chief is positioning himself for the 2015 elections? According to several sources inside the military, Min Aung Hlaing, who will reach retirement age that same year, is quietly preparing a run for the presidency. Some of Burma's military lawmakers have stated that the armed forces will nominate Min Aung Hlaing as a presidential candidate in 2015. If this is the case, Min Aung Hlaing's \"human security\" rhetoric might well resonate with the public's aspiration, and he could present himself as a statesman with a clear political vision, perhaps enabling him to profit from intense personal rivalries among the other contenders, including the incumbent president Thein Sein, the parliamentary speaker Thura Shwe Mann, and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In any event, it's quite clear that observers of Burma's political scene will find themselves paying even closer attention to the doings of Min Aung Hlaing in the months to come.

Craig Hacker for The New York Times WICHITA, Kan. \u2014 Reasoning that more guns mean greater safety, Kansas lawmakers voted last year to require cities and counties to make public buildings accessible to people legally carrying concealed weapons.But for communities that remained wary of such open access to city halls, libraries, museums and courthouses, the Legislature provided an exemption: Guns can be banned as long as local governments pay for protections like metal detectors and security guards, ensuring the safety of those they have disarmed.It turns out that in Wichita, the state\u2019s most populous city, and in some other towns, the cost of opting out before the Jan. 1 deadline was just too high.\u201cIt was essentially being foisted upon us,\u201d said Janet Miller, a City Council member in Wichita. The city applied over the summer for a six-month exemption but voted last month not to extend it after the police estimated that it would cost $14 million a year to restrict guns in all 107 city-owned buildings. While Republican-majority legislatures across the country are easing restrictions on gun owners, few states are putting more pressure on municipalities right now than Kansas. The new law has forced some local leaders to weigh policy conviction against fiscal pragmatism in a choice that critics say was flawed from the start: Open vulnerable locations to concealed side arms or stretch meager budgets to cover the extra security measures. Mayor Carl Brewer opposed the decision to open Wichita-owned buildings to concealed weapons. \"We have a lot of inexperienced individuals with weapons, and you just never can tell what can happen,\" he said. Craig Hacker for The New York Times \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to the taxpayer to ask them to fork out those kinds of dollars,\u201d said Ms. Miller, who wanted more time to weigh options but admitted that choices were slim. \u201cThere is no municipality in the state of Kansas that can afford those infrastructure costs.\u201dThe law, signed by Gov. Sam Brownback in April, permitted local governments to apply for a four-year grace period by notifying the state attorney general\u2019s office and developing security plans by Jan. 1. Architects of the bill said it was intended to put local leaders on the spot, as municipalities that do not comply will lose liability protections under the statute. Just weeks before the deadline, officials across Kansas were still examining foot traffic and prioritizing the facilities they wanted to keep gun-free, said Melissa A. Wangemann, general counsel for the Kansas Association of Counties.\u201cFor some of your smaller, more rural areas, it\u2019s just not economically feasible,\u201d she said. Some considered closing entrances to limit the security expense. The Kansas Board of Regents, which runs the state\u2019s public universities, and the library system in Topeka were among those seeking the extended exemption, delaying the issue until 2018.

Onlookers are worried that Erdogan's actions threaten the very&#13;\nessence of Turkish democracy. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe&#13;\n<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21592614-government-recep-tayyip-erdogan-has-grave-questions-answer-arab-road\" target=\"_blank\">scandal</a> centers on a&#13;\nseries of bribes and gold transfers allegedly paid to high-ranking members of&#13;\nthe ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), four ministers, and even&#13;\nErdogan's son in relation to various real estate deals around Turkey. On Dec.&#13;\n17, police detained over 50 suspects, who have also been implicated in <a href=\"http://www.therightperspective.org/2013/12/29/turkeys-119b-iranian-money-laundering-scandal/#sthash.4sCIAIhs.dpbs\" target=\"_blank\">money laundering</a> to help Iran&#13;\nevade sanctions. (In the photo above, anti-government protesters hold a sign that reads, \"Catch the thief!\") &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nWhile&#13;\nthe corruption scandal is shocking in itself, the reaction of the Erdogan&#13;\ngovernment is, to many in Turkey, even more worrisome. Erdogan appears to have&#13;\nmade up his mind to further undermine the separation of powers, weaken&#13;\ndemocratic institutions, and eliminate checks and balances, despite sharp <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/eu-expresses-concern-over-police-sackings-in-turkey/a-17348315\" target=\"_blank\">criticism</a> from the&#13;\ninternational community and the European Union, in what is being called a \"slow-motion&#13;\ncoup.\" Ironically, the government has argued that its drastic response was&#13;\nmeant to target members and affiliates of the <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2013/1229/The-Gulen-movement-a-self-exiled-imam-challenges-Turkey-s-Erdogan\" target=\"_blank\">Gulen movement</a> (an Islamic&#13;\ngroup with growing influence within Turkey), who have allegedly been organizing&#13;\nto <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/turkce/haberler/2014/01/140115_erdogan_darbe.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">unseat</a> the&#13;\ndemocratically elected government. Excuses notwithstanding, the corruption&#13;\nscandal and the government's response to it have already weakened democratic&#13;\naccountability in Turkey, and deepened dividing lines among an already&#13;\npolarized populace. Once lauded for its democratic strength, or at least its&#13;\nwillingness to move up the democratic ladder, Turkey threatens to become just&#13;\nlike many others in its neighborhood: a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy\" target=\"_blank\">hybrid regime</a> ruled by a&#13;\nstrong man who does not even try to give his rule the pretense of a democracy.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n<span class=\"pull-quote\">At&#13;\nfirst, Erdogan was slow to react -- and once he did it was clear that he was using&#13;\nthe scandal to consolidate his own power while taking a swipe at his critics.</span> It&#13;\ntook him nine full days to ask for the resignations of the three ministers&#13;\nimplicated in the scandal; when he finally did, it was quickly followed by a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303799404579279631623290934\" target=\"_blank\">cabinet overhaul</a> in which he&#13;\nreplaced 10 minsters with party members and allies.

The government&#13;\nalso went after the state's own investigative bodies, firing the chief&#13;\nprosecutor (<a href=\"http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/zekeriya_oz_basbakanin_gonderdigi_2_kisi_sorusturmayi_durdurmami_istedi-1169932\" target=\"_blank\">Zekeriya Oz</a>) -- whom&#13;\nErdogan spent several weeks <a href=\"http://t24.com.tr/haber/zekeriya-oz-once-yipratma-sonra-ziplatma-yaptilar/247906\" target=\"_blank\">attacking</a> -- and several&#13;\nhigh-ranking bureaucrats in the Corruption Investigation Unit of the Ministry&#13;\nof the Treasury. Muammer Akkas, the prosecutor who ordered the unsuccessful interrogation&#13;\nof Erdogan's son during the second round of arrests, has been removed from the&#13;\ncase, prompting him to issue a <a href=\"http://t24.com.tr/haber/savci-akkas-ben-bilgi-veya-belge-sizdirmadim/247229\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> condemning&#13;\npolitical interference in the judicial process. A similar witch hunt within the&#13;\nruling AKP itself led to the <a href=\"http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/ertugrul_gunay_istifa_etti_kibir_yolunda_basarilar_dilerim-1168272\" target=\"_blank\">resignation</a> of several high-ranking&#13;\nmembers who dared to criticize the way Erdogan handled the scandal. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nFrom&#13;\nthe start, Erdogan's strategy has been to violate the separation powers and&#13;\ninterfere where a prime minister should not. Sadly,&#13;\nthis does not come as much of a surprise. The prime minister himself has&#13;\nfrequently <a href=\"http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/bir-yanlis-yaptik.htm\" target=\"_blank\">attacked</a> the&#13;\njudiciary and has threatened to curtail judicial independence whenever court&#13;\ndecisions <a href=\"http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/yargitaydan_erdogana_yanit_bizim_siyasetle_isimiz_yok-981799\" target=\"_blank\">opposed</a> him on&#13;\nissues ranging from <a href=\"http://haber.sol.org.tr/devlet-ve-siyaset/erdogan-konustu-ulkede-ve-bolgede-ne-varsa-saldirdi-haberi-64748\" target=\"_blank\">privatization</a>&#13;\ndeals to <a href=\"http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/basbakan_erdogandan_yargitay_baskanina_cevap-989384\" target=\"_blank\">constitutional law</a>.&#13;\nEven before the corruption scandal, Erdogan <a href=\"http://www.dunya.com/kuvvetler-ayriligi-onumuze-engel-oluyor-174971h.htm\" target=\"_blank\">questioned</a>&#13;\nthe logic of the separation of powers and asked the judiciary to act in&#13;\ncohesion with the executive and legislative powers. The government&#13;\nhas proposed new legislation that imposes further limits on any remaining&#13;\njudicial independence. The bill increases the power of the Erdogan-controlled Ministry&#13;\nof Justice at the expense of independent justices in the Higher Council of&#13;\nJudges and Prosecutors.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nThe&#13;\ngovernment has also taken steps to limit public access to information on the&#13;\ninvestigation.

The Erdogan government's reaction to the scandal has&#13;\nbrought Turkey closer to the club of authoritarian countries including Russia,&#13;\nChina, and Iran, and further away from the EU. Ironically, in its earlier years,&#13;\nthe Erdogan government did more than any other government before it to push for&#13;\nTurkish membership in EU, and actually succeeded in starting <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/eu_turkey_relations_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">accession</a> negotiations&#13;\nfor an eventual membership in 2005. During this time, Erdogan openly supported&#13;\nTurkey's EU bid, and exploited it in his struggle against the country's once all-powerful&#13;\nmilitary. Since then, however, the relationship between EU and Turkey has&#13;\nturned increasingly <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/columnists/amanda-paul_336556-erdogan-and-the-eu-a-love-affair-turned-sour.html\" target=\"_blank\">sour</a>,&#13;\nespecially following Erdogan's authoritarian power grabs following 2010&#13;\nconstitutional referendum.

It's now clear that the implications of the scandal go far beyond the reach of corruption. Onlookers are worried that Erdogan's actions threaten the very essence of Turkish democracy. The scandal centers on a series of bribes and gold transfers allegedly paid to high-ranking members of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), four ministers, and even Erdogan's son in relation to various real estate deals around Turkey. On Dec. 17, police detained over 50 suspects, who have also been implicated in money laundering to help Iran evade sanctions. (In the photo above, anti-government protesters hold a sign that reads, \"Catch the thief!\") While the corruption scandal is shocking in itself, the reaction of the Erdogan government is, to many in Turkey, even more worrisome. Erdogan appears to have made up his mind to further undermine the separation of powers, weaken democratic institutions, and eliminate checks and balances, despite sharp criticism from the international community and the European Union, in what is being called a \"slow-motion coup.\" Ironically, the government has argued that its drastic response was meant to target members and affiliates of the Gulen movement (an Islamic group with growing influence within Turkey), who have allegedly been organizing to unseat the democratically elected government. Excuses notwithstanding, the corruption scandal and the government's response to it have already weakened democratic accountability in Turkey, and deepened dividing lines among an already polarized populace. Once lauded for its democratic strength, or at least its willingness to move up the democratic ladder, Turkey threatens to become just like many others in its neighborhood: a hybrid regime ruled by a strong man who does not even try to give his rule the pretense of a democracy. At first, Erdogan was slow to react -- and once he did it was clear that he was using the scandal to consolidate his own power while taking a swipe at his critics. It took him nine full days to ask for the resignations of the three ministers implicated in the scandal; when he finally did, it was quickly followed by a cabinet overhaul in which he replaced 10 minsters with party members and allies. The Erdogan government has also responded to the investigation by purging more than 1,000 police officers -- including dozens of bureau chiefs in key positions in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and other cities -- who were involved in the investigation and are suspected members of the Gulen movement. The government also went after the state's own investigative bodies, firing the chief prosecutor (Zekeriya Oz) -- whom Erdogan spent several weeks attacking -- and several high-ranking bureaucrats in the Corruption Investigation Unit of the Ministry of the Treasury. Muammer Akkas, the prosecutor who ordered the unsuccessful interrogation of Erdogan's son during the second round of arrests, has been removed from the case, prompting him to issue a press release condemning political interference in the judicial process. A similar witch hunt within the ruling AKP itself led to the resignation of several high-ranking members who dared to criticize the way Erdogan handled the scandal. From the start, Erdogan's strategy has been to violate the separation powers and interfere where a prime minister should not. Sadly, this does not come as much of a surprise. The prime minister himself has frequently attacked the judiciary and has threatened to curtail judicial independence whenever court decisions opposed him on issues ranging from privatization deals to constitutional law. Even before the corruption scandal, Erdogan questioned the logic of the separation of powers and asked the judiciary to act in cohesion with the executive and legislative powers. The government has proposed new legislation that imposes further limits on any remaining judicial independence. The bill increases the power of the Erdogan-controlled Ministry of Justice at the expense of independent justices in the Higher Council of Judges and Prosecutors. The government has also taken steps to limit public access to information on the investigation. The Istanbul police headquarters is now closed to journalists, restricting press access to information from inside sources. Police officers are now required to notify Ankara before launching any criminal inquiry, further violating the separation of judicial and executive powers. The government also passed a series of laws increasing Internet censorship, which has already led to the shutdown of at least one opposition news portal, and on Jan. 20, the court officially issued a ban on press coverage of the case. Erdogan's government has repeatedly used intimidation and threats to silence journalists, and this case is no exception. For the second consecutive year, Turkey has the highest number of jailed journalists in the world, surpassing Russia, China, and even Iran, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Dozens of prominent journalists, such as Hasan Cemal and Can Dundar of Milliyet, and Yavuz Baydar of Sabah, have been fired for openly criticizing Erdogan.

Iran offered to join the United States in sending military aid to Iraq\u2019s Shiite government. Ali al-Mashhadani/Reuters TEHRAN \u2014 Even as the United States and Iran pursue negotiations on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, they find themselves on the same side of a range of regional issues surrounding an insurgency raging across the Middle East.While the two governments quietly continue to pursue their often conflicting interests, they are being drawn together by their mutual opposition to an international movement of young Sunni fighters, who with their pickup trucks and Kalashnikovs are raising the black flag of Al Qaeda along sectarian fault lines in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen.The United States, reluctant to intervene in bloody, inconclusive conflicts, is seeing its regional influence decline, while Iraq, which cost the Americans $1 trillion and more than 4,000 lives, is growing increasingly unstable. Related Coverage At the same time, Shiite-dominated Iran, the magnetic pole for the Shiite minority in the region, has its own reasons to be nervous, with the ragtag army of Sunni militants threatening Syria and Iraq, both important allies, and the United States drawing down its troops in Afghanistan.On Monday, Iran offered to join the United States in sending military aid to the Shiite government in Baghdad, which is embroiled in street-to-street fighting with radical Sunni militants in Anbar Province, a Sunni stronghold. On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said he could envision an Iranian role in the coming peace conference on Syria, even though the meeting is supposed to plan for a Syria after the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, an important Iranian ally.To some, the Iranian moves reflect the clever pragmatism of Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, aimed at building their country into a regional power. To others critical of the potential reconciliation, the moves are window dressing aimed at lulling the West into complacency while Tehran pursues nuclear weapons and supports its own jihadists throughout the region.Yet even Iranians outside the reformist camp see the shared interests as undeniable. \u201cIt is clear we are increasingly reaching common ground with the Americans,\u201d said one of them, Aziz Shahmohammadi, a former adviser to Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council. \u201cNo country should have an eternal enemy, neither we nor the United States.\u201dWith Iran as an island of stability in a region plagued by violent protests, sectarian clashes and suicide bombers, there are not that many options left for Washington, experts here say.\u201cWe face the same enemy, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\u201d said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a prominent Iranian reformist journalist who closely follows the Arab world. He recalled how Iranian intelligence operatives gave reliable information to American Special Forces troops battling Iran\u2019s enemy, the Afghan Taliban, in 2001.While the Obama administration acknowledges that Iran has the potential to be an influential player on regional issues from Afghanistan to Syria, senior officials have said they are keeping their focus tightly on the nuclear negotiations. Cooperation on any other issues, they said, hinges largely on coming to terms on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.The administration has concluded that Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif have been empowered to negotiate on the nuclear program, but officials said it remained unclear whether their policy-making authority extended to regional issues like Syria. There, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps holds vast influence through its Quds Force, and it is supplying weapons to Hezbollah in an effort to prop up President Assad\u2019s government.The thaw in relations extends back almost a year, with the two countries making overtures long thought impossible, deeply angering Washington\u2019s closest regional allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel.As early as last spring, a series of secret talks in Oman and Geneva laid the groundwork for re-establishing relations, cut over three decades ago after Iranian students took American diplomats hostage in revolutionary Tehran.In September came the agreement \u2014 credited to President Vladimir V.

The two together are forging a level of control that political observers say holds echoes of the sort of family dynasty that the Sandinista Front once took up arms to topple. While Ortega and Murillo work in tandem, Murillo handles much of day-to-day governing while Ortega deals with strategy. Some analysts guess at who holds more clout.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s her indispensable left hand,\u201d said Carlos Denton, president of CID Gallup Centroamerica, a regional polling firm. \u201cMany Nicaraguans think she runs the government.\u201d</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Call any government official or any Sandinista Front deputy in the National Assembly, and he or she is unlikely to speak without Murillo\u2019s OK, which is hard to get.

If there is a health problem, it is not the health minister who speaks. It is her,\u201d said Oscar-Rene Vargas, a Swiss-trained sociologist who was a supporter of the Sandinista Front when it took power for the first time in 1979 after an armed revolution against the US-backed dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza.</p><p>The Sandinistas left power after losing an election in 1990, and Ortega failed in two later campaigns for the presidency. But he squeaked out a victory in 2006 and triumphed easily in 2011, with help from allies on the country\u2019s Supreme Court, despite a constitutional ban on re-election.</p><p>In December, the National Assembly abolished term limits on presidents, paving the way for Ortega to be elected indefinitely \u2013 harkening back to the tactics that kept the Somoza family dynasty in power for 44 years.</p>\t\n\t<p>Anastasio Somoza and his US-educated sons used the National Guard as their power base, treated Nicaragua as their ranch, and kept absolute control over the country. The <a href=\"/tags/topic/United+States\" title=\"Title: United States\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States</a> supported their extended rule. Franklin D. Roosevelt allegedly said of Mr. Somoza in 1939 that he \u201cmay be a son of a bitch, but he\u2019s our son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Ortega\u2019s current move to permit indefinite re-election set off alarm bells in some sectors, most notably the episcopal conference of Roman Catholic prelates, which warned of \u201cthe perpetuation of a long-term absolute power.\u201d The National Assembly will consider the matter again early this year.</p><p>Until then, however, the question for many here is whether Ortega would ever cede power to his wife. Those who have known the two say their relationship is complicated, and sometimes strained.</p><p>Murillo would be a stark contrast to Ortega, a man with simple tastes. His only known luxury is a set of silver Mercedes-Benz SUVs.</p><p>Murillo, who is 62 to Ortega\u2019s 68, enjoys not only abundant jewelry but also an impressive wardrobe. The opposition La Prensa newspaper in 2012 reviewed 463 official photos of her over the previous three years and found that she wore 462 different outfits.</p><p>Her current list of titles starts with government spokeswoman. But she\u2019s also Cabinet chief on all social issues and <a href=\"/World/Americas/2013/1112/Is-Nicaragua-s-Constitution-facing-an-extreme-Sandinista-makeover\" target=\"_blank\">presides over the Councils of Citizen Power</a>, ubiquitous neighborhood groups that channel food aid and other assistance.</p><p>In the 35 years that Ortega and Murillo have been a couple \u2013 they finally married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in 2005 \u2013 Ortega has gone through a metamorphosis, leaving behind the socialism of his revolutionary youth to become, by many accounts, one of Nicaragua\u2019s richest men. The business elite, which once so detested Ortega that it rose up in the 1980s to join a US-backed insurgency against him, now sees him as a reliable ally in growing their wealth unimpeded.</p><p>Under Ortega, Nicaragua\u2019s economy has grown briskly, outpaced only by Panama\u2019s in <a href=\"/tags/topic/Central+America\" title=\"Title: Central America\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Central America</a>. Labor unrest has all but ended. Business owners are largely happy. Ortega\u2019s assistance programs, providing zinc roofing and piglets to the poor with up to $500 million a year in off-the-books aid from Venezuela, have boosted the president\u2019s popularity.</p><p>\u201cThis is an apparatus that fixes your teeth,\u201d Arturo Cruz, a former ambassador to the United States, said of Ortega\u2019s Sandinista Front. \u201cWhen you die, there is someone from the government . . . that will help you get buried.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s also done well for Murillo, who oversees social programs, which directly benefit 140,000 families among Nicaragua\u2019s 5 million citizens. Many of the poor, particularly women, associate her with the programs and feel gratitude.</p><p>\u201cShe really helps out women,\u201d said Jeannette Lopez, a young mother of seven children in a poor Managua neighborhood near the Lenin Fonseca Hospital. Lopez recently received a free two-room, zinc-roofed home from the government.</p><p>\u201cThe house came in my name. It was a requirement. This is because men leave their wives and give them nothing,\u201d Ms. Lopez said.</p><p>Aura Martinez, who oversees the citizens power council in the surrounding neighborhood, brushed aside questions about Murillo\u2019s quirkiness, such as her propensity to accessorize or her recent ordering that 40 or so metal yellow \u201cTrees of Life,\u201d each some 40 feet tall, be installed at key intersections in the capital. The trees with their curlicue branches and bright lights give a glitzy Las Vegas neon feel to the capital.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just her thing. It\u2019s her style to use lots of earrings and bracelets,\u201d Ms. Martinez said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kitsch,\u201d said Sofia Montenegro, a former Sandinista who is now a women\u2019s activist. \u201cShe\u2019s changed all the national symbols.\u201d</p><p>In addition to the towering artificial trees, Murillo has ordered \u201cHands of Fatima\u201d \u2013 open palms with an all-seeing eye in the middle \u2013 painted in several party buildings and uses the ancient symbol of two serpents swallowing each other\u2019s tails.</p><p>\u201cRosario has been known since she was young for having a bunch of eclectic New Age, shamanic and Christian beliefs,\u201d Ms. Montenegro said. \u201cThis amalgam of beliefs has become official credo.\u201d</p><p>Murillo had virtually no role during the 1979-1990 Sandinista regime. Her rise coincided with a sordid family scandal. In 1998, Murillo\u2019s daughter from an earlier liaison, Zoilamerica Narvaez, accused Ortega, who adopted her in 1986, of molesting her since she was age 11.</p><p>Murillo sided with Ortega in the incest dispute, calling her own daughter mentally unstable and a political enemy.</p><p>\u201cShe repudiated her daughter and backed Daniel Ortega,\u201d Montenegro said. \u201cThis support had a price: She demanded half the power.\u201d</p><p>Even after Ms. Narvaez dropped a lawsuit over the matter, she claimed in May 2013 that state pressure against European donors had forced her nonprofit think tank into insolvency. A month later, immigration officials deported her Bolivian companion to Costa Rica, and she soon followed him there into exile.</p><p>An opposition legislator, Luis Callejas, said the Narvaez incident was emblematic of the Ortega government\u2019s gritty determination to silence critics.</p><p>\u201cWhat there is here is dictatorship. Make no mistake. They have power of all branches of state,\u201d Callejas said. \u201cThe business owners are afraid that they\u2019ll be pursued for tax reasons. The prevailing attitude is, \u2018Don\u2019t get involved in politics and you can go on.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Critics of Ortega said he has funneled some of the annual slush fund from Venezuela into investments in hotels, energy distribution, and banking.</p><p>Ortega and Murillo have nine shared children, between their own and those from other liaisons. Since Ortega returned to power in 2007, neither he nor Murillo has ever offered a news conference open to all media, choosing instead to speak through a website or trusted state news outlets they control.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re repeating the same history as Somoza,\u201d said Vargas, the sociologist. \u201cEach one of his children has a business, and then you\u2019ve got the spouses. So there are 40 to 50 Ortegas with businesses.\u201d</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concentration of power, and this is not good,\u201d said Diego Vargas Montealegre, president of the board of the Nicaraguan-American Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no institutional counterweight to them,\u201d added Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a former editor of the Sandinista newspaper who now is a critic of the Ortega government. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the comptroller, the Supreme Court, the prosecutors, the National Assembly, all of it.\u201d</p><p>Some see Murillo as biding her time, waiting for her day as leader, ready to replace Ortega should his health fail. Ortega is said to suffer from debilitating lupus or another illness that prevents him from going outside much during daylight hours.</p><p>\u201cIf she thinks she can win power against the will of Daniel, she\u2019ll lose,\u201d said Daniel Aguirre Solis, a retired legislator and newspaper editor who used to work with Murillo at La Prensa newspaper in the 1970s. The army remains loyal to Ortega, not Murillo, he added.</p><p>Even if Ortega cedes power to his wife some day, Mr. Aguirre said he thinks the economic situation could lead to the family\u2019s eventual downfall, given poverty that remains stubbornly high at 45 percent.</p><p>\u201cThe Venezuelan money could disappear. Inflation could rise,\u201d Aguirre said.</p><p>\u201cThis will end up badly,\u201d said Callejas, the opposition lawmaker. \u201cThere will be social revolt.

Thus far, the loudest voices in the West&#13;\ndenouncing the measure have come from politicians and gay rights activists,&#13;\nmost of whom fall on the left side of the political spectrum.

To their credit, they were suspicious&#13;\nof Putin long before the world's gay activists joined the bandwagon, raising&#13;\nskepticism about the administration's foolish and failed \"reset\" policy when&#13;\nmany liberals were claiming that America needed to \"repair\" its relationship&#13;\nwith Moscow (as if such a thing could ever be done, on morally acceptable&#13;\nterms, with Putin still in power). The propaganda law offers one of those rare,&#13;\nbipartisan political opportunities where left and right can come together.&#13;\nPresenting the law as part and parcel of Putin's broad crackdown on Russian&#13;\ncivil society will expand the coalition of voices speaking out against it.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\n<span class=\"pull-quote\">Framing the debate as one over fundamental&#13;\nrights like freedom of speech and association (as opposed to \"gay rights\") is&#13;\nnot a distortion -- for that's exactly what it's really about.</span> The tenor of the&#13;\nprotest campaign thus far in the West, conducted as it has been almost&#13;\nexclusively by gay groups and celebrities, has allowed Putin to paint himself&#13;\nas a traditionalist standing athwart the creeping tide of same-sex marriage.&#13;\nBut no one in Russia is calling for gay marriage. Indeed, it would be bizarre&#13;\nwere the U.S. State Department to insist upon same-sex marriage in other&#13;\ncountries when the issue has just barely begun to play out in the United&#13;\nStates, and when Americans themselves remain deeply divided on the topic.&#13;\nRussian gays and their (pitifully few) straight allies are simply asking that&#13;\nthe government stop singling out homosexuals for discrimination, and that they&#13;\nhave the right to assemble peaceably and express their opinions.&#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nPutin's Manichean rhetoric also obscures the&#13;\nfact that a country need not embrace the full panoply of gay rights to be&#13;\nconsidered a liberal democracy or part of the \"West.\" There exist wide&#13;\ndisparities among EU member states with respect to the rights they afford to&#13;\ngay citizens, with some countries, like the Netherlands, offering full marriage&#13;\nequality, while others, like Slovakia, offer no relationship recognition&#13;\nwhatsoever. Yet what unites the democracies of the EU and the West more broadly&#13;\nis that they are obliged to ensure freedom of association and speech for all of&#13;\ntheir citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. That means activists&#13;\nmust be permitted to hold gay pride parades (even if it requires heavy police&#13;\nprotection) and be free to state their opinions in public.

But there was one big problem: his regime has been devoid of the ideological raison d'\u00eatre provided by communism. Whereas the Soviet Union was once able to muster support from people around the globe as the world headquarters of Marxist-Leninism, Putin's Russia offered little in the way of comparable ideological appeal (other than to revanchist Russians seeking a vague return to their country's former glory). Now the Kremlin seems to have settled upon a new international brand: the protection of \"traditional values\" from the forces of cosmopolitanism and post-nationalism.

The main street looks as if it was based on a child\u2019s crayon drawing\u2014a riotous palette of pinks, blues, and oranges\u2014and the residents are frighteningly still. In fact, most aren\u2019t even real. Instead, the town features such sights as a pair of petrified pigeons, yellow phone booths, and a statue of a sea dog gazing from a bridge.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to \u201cSpring Legend,\u201d a mock-Alpine town located in Huairou, a designated green-belt district about 35 miles from Beijing.

Entering the town\u2019s German restaurant\u2014outside of which sits a statue of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill enjoying a bronze cigar\u2014tables are set with fine china, wine goblets, silver cutlery, and linen, all neatly laid out for diners who never arrive. Then, a waitress dressed as a Bavarian <em>fr\u00e4ulein</em> appears and inquires how many there will be for lunch.</p>\n\n<p>The town\u2019s motto is \u201cThe Beautiful Legend From the Alps\u201d and indeed, compared to the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/13/unlivable_cities\">livability</a> problems of Chinese cities, Spring Legend has a pleasant environment.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">Tables are set with fine china, wine goblets, silver cutlery, and linen, all neatly laid out for diners who never arrive.</aside><p>\u201cWe named it Spring Legend because it\u2019s close to the river and has a small creek running through it,\u201d explains Liu Xinhu, the chairman of Ding Xiu Zhi Ye (Spring Legend Properties). \u201cIt\u2019s extremely beautiful in the spring, too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The town was conceived back in 2007, towards the end of a period of rapid development in Beijing that led to an increase in pollution and, correspondingly, a renewed interest among city-dwellers in a serene environment. \u201cMany people wanted to \u2018return to the countryside,\u2019\u201d recalls Liu, referring to a Cultural Revolution-era program that sent urban youths to rural China in order to work on farms.</p>\n\n<p>Spring Legend is empty for one simple reason: During the week, hardly anyone lives there. An estimated 80 percent of the town\u2019s homeowners also have apartments in Beijing, and, according to Liu, the general occupancy rate in Spring Legend is only about 60 to 70 percent. Multiple-home ownership among China\u2019s rich is not uncommon; University at Albany professor Youqin\u00a0Huang has estimated that 15 percent of urban households in the country own two or more houses.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of property ownership has changed greatly in China. Fifteen years ago, state workers (who then comprised much of the population) were assigned basic accommodation. But today, home ownership has become so important that young men <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/21/business/la-fi-china-bachelor-20100621\">struggle to find a girlfriend if they do not own their own home.</a> Buying a place, however, is difficult: Average salaries in Beijing top out at about 4,500 RMB per month (around $750), while the cost of an apartment in the city center is around 43,000 to 52,000 RMB per square meter.</p>\n\n<p>Why has China gone mad for housing? With strict capital controls and a state-controlled stock exchange that is volatile and risky, the tangible reassurance of evergreen property has made it a \u201cfungible commodity,\u201d in the words of Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based equities analysis firm J Capital Research. She says that homes are usually left empty in order to avoid any depreciation in value.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRenovation costs are very high, so it makes no sense to rent if you are seeking capital appreciation,\u201d she explains via e-mail. \u201cRemember that apartments here are sold bare, without flooring, ceilings, lighting fixtures or wall tiles. They all need to be installed, adding at least 20 percent to the cost [and] people expect to ... custom fit the unit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This means that even in successful towns like Spring Legend\u2014where a unit costs an average of 16,000 RMB (about $2,500) per square meter, roughly a third the cost of a typical apartment in central Beijing\u2014the streets and houses remain lifeless. The owners, says Bianca Bosker, author of <em><a href=\"http://biancabosker.com/OriginalCopies\">Original Copies: Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China</a>,</em> are \u201cdreaming of what they\u2019ll do\u00a0with the riches they imagine they\u2019ll get when they one day sell them.\u201d The likely answer? Buy more property. However, \u201cGiven how many people have hatched the same \u2018get rich quick\u2019 real-estate idea, and how many of China\u2019s gated communities stand empty, betting on real estate looks increasingly risky.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p>Spring Legend is hardly the only city of its kind. There's also Thames Town, outside Shanghai, which is a $300 million British-style residential complex developed by since-incarcerated Shanghai Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu. And north of Beijing in Hebei Province is Jackson Hole, a wind-swept Wild West replica featuring neighborhoods called Moose Creek, Route 66, and Aspen Land. When developers previewed Jackson Hole in 2003, buyer interest was intense. The homes \u201csold out in record time,\u201d says Oregon-based designer Allison Smith, who helped create the settlement. Early investors who purchased an \u201cAmerican villa\u201d for around a quarter-million dollars in 2006 have seen their dreams \u201ctriple in value,\u201d she estimates.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/churchhill/395e33279.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">A bust of Winston Churchill outside a restaurant in Spring Legend, a mock-European community near Beijing. (Phoebe Storm)</figcaption></figure><p>Jackson Hole bucks the trend: It is a living community, a mix of older families and retirees drawn by what Smith agrees is a serendipitous confluence of factors\u2014co-operative developers, clever marketing, and a great location. But Smith fears there\u2019s a downside to the speculation. \u201cAt this point, the Chinese are in such a rush to buy everything, it may not hold its value down the line,\u201d she says. \u201cJackson Hole doesn\u2019t have that problem; people want to stay there. People want to live there. We've done something positive\u2014it\u2019s not just for the money.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not every fake European village is so successful. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkcBq9V8uao\">Luodian New Town</a>, also known as North European New Town, is a development in Shanghai\u2019s suburban Baoshan district supposedly based on the historic Swedish town of Sigtuna.

The town of Spring Legend, modeled after a European village, has struggled to attract permanent residents. (Phoebe Storm)BEIJING \u2014 There\u2019s a town on the outskirts of Beijing that might just be the strangest you\u2019ll ever see. The main street looks as if it was based on a child\u2019s crayon drawing\u2014a riotous palette of pinks, blues, and oranges\u2014and the residents are frighteningly still. In fact, most aren\u2019t even real. Instead, the town features such sights as a pair of petrified pigeons, yellow phone booths, and a statue of a sea dog gazing from a bridge. Welcome to \u201cSpring Legend,\u201d a mock-Alpine town located in Huairou, a designated green-belt district about 35 miles from Beijing. The town has existed for about five years, but it lacks something fundamental: residents. Spring Legend has the feel of a dream come true. Entering the town\u2019s German restaurant\u2014outside of which sits a statue of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill enjoying a bronze cigar\u2014tables are set with fine china, wine goblets, silver cutlery, and linen, all neatly laid out for diners who never arrive. Then, a waitress dressed as a Bavarian fr\u00e4ulein appears and inquires how many there will be for lunch. The town\u2019s motto is \u201cThe Beautiful Legend From the Alps\u201d and indeed, compared to the livability problems of Chinese cities, Spring Legend has a pleasant environment. Tables are set with fine china, wine goblets, silver cutlery, and linen, all neatly laid out for diners who never arrive.\u201cWe named it Spring Legend because it\u2019s close to the river and has a small creek running through it,\u201d explains Liu Xinhu, the chairman of Ding Xiu Zhi Ye (Spring Legend Properties). \u201cIt\u2019s extremely beautiful in the spring, too.\u201d The town was conceived back in 2007, towards the end of a period of rapid development in Beijing that led to an increase in pollution and, correspondingly, a renewed interest among city-dwellers in a serene environment. \u201cMany people wanted to \u2018return to the countryside,\u2019\u201d recalls Liu, referring to a Cultural Revolution-era program that sent urban youths to rural China in order to work on farms. Spring Legend is empty for one simple reason: During the week, hardly anyone lives there. An estimated 80 percent of the town\u2019s homeowners also have apartments in Beijing, and, according to Liu, the general occupancy rate in Spring Legend is only about 60 to 70 percent. Multiple-home ownership among China\u2019s rich is not uncommon; University at Albany professor Youqin Huang has estimated that 15 percent of urban households in the country own two or more houses. The nature of property ownership has changed greatly in China. Fifteen years ago, state workers (who then comprised much of the population) were assigned basic accommodation. But today, home ownership has become so important that young men struggle to find a girlfriend if they do not own their own home. Buying a place, however, is difficult: Average salaries in Beijing top out at about 4,500 RMB per month (around $750), while the cost of an apartment in the city center is around 43,000 to 52,000 RMB per square meter. Why has China gone mad for housing? With strict capital controls and a state-controlled stock exchange that is volatile and risky, the tangible reassurance of evergreen property has made it a \u201cfungible commodity,\u201d in the words of Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based equities analysis firm J Capital Research. She says that homes are usually left empty in order to avoid any depreciation in value. \u201cRenovation costs are very high, so it makes no sense to rent if you are seeking capital appreciation,\u201d she explains via e-mail. \u201cRemember that apartments here are sold bare, without flooring, ceilings, lighting fixtures or wall tiles. They all need to be installed, adding at least 20 percent to the cost [and] people expect to ... custom fit the unit.\u201d This means that even in successful towns like Spring Legend\u2014where a unit costs an average of 16,000 RMB (about $2,500) per square meter, roughly a third the cost of a typical apartment in central Beijing\u2014the streets and houses remain lifeless. The owners, says Bianca Bosker, author of Original Copies: Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China, are \u201cdreaming of what they\u2019ll do with the riches they imagine they\u2019ll get when they one day sell them.\u201d The likely answer? Buy more property. However, \u201cGiven how many people have hatched the same \u2018get rich quick\u2019 real-estate idea, and how many of China\u2019s gated communities stand empty, betting on real estate looks increasingly risky.\u201d *** Spring Legend is hardly the only city of its kind. There's also Thames Town, outside Shanghai, which is a $300 million British-style residential complex developed by since-incarcerated Shanghai Communist Party boss Chen Liangyu. And north of Beijing in Hebei Province is Jackson Hole, a wind-swept Wild West replica featuring neighborhoods called Moose Creek, Route 66, and Aspen Land. When developers previewed Jackson Hole in 2003, buyer interest was intense. The homes \u201csold out in record time,\u201d says Oregon-based designer Allison Smith, who helped create the settlement. Early investors who purchased an \u201cAmerican villa\u201d for around a quarter-million dollars in 2006 have seen their dreams \u201ctriple in value,\u201d she estimates. A bust of Winston Churchill outside a restaurant in Spring Legend, a mock-European community near Beijing. (Phoebe Storm)Jackson Hole bucks the trend: It is a living community, a mix of older families and retirees drawn by what Smith agrees is a serendipitous confluence of factors\u2014co-operative developers, clever marketing, and a great location. But Smith fears there\u2019s a downside to the speculation. \u201cAt this point, the Chinese are in such a rush to buy everything, it may not hold its value down the line,\u201d she says. \u201cJackson Hole doesn\u2019t have that problem; people want to stay there. People want to live there. We've done something positive\u2014it\u2019s not just for the money.\" Not every fake European village is so successful. Luodian New Town, also known as North European New Town, is a development in Shanghai\u2019s suburban Baoshan district supposedly based on the historic Swedish town of Sigtuna. According to Bosker, \u201cits foreign architects [Swedish firm Sweco] failed to take into account Chinese lifestyles or customs\u2014specifically, the principles of feng shui.\u201d The developers at first banned any remodeling but, as homes failed to sell, they caved.

With taxes collected centrally and then redistributed to local governments, land has become the principle source of income for provincial officials, who normally can expect a redistribution of only 50 percent of fiscal revenue after paying 85 percent of the municipal purse, according to Pan. Grandiose land projects, thus, are a ripe moneymaking vehicle for officials. German houses are too dark-colored,\u201d Liu argues. \u201cThey look depressing.\u201d\u201cThis creates bubbles, because the prosperity of properties and cities ultimately comes from the accumulation of people, but developing real estate alone doesn\u2019t create jobs\u2014so [these new towns] don\u2019t attract laborers or their families. As a result, only the land per se is \u2018urbanized,\u2019 and so become the \u2018ghost towns\u2019 that we see.\u201d As with many real-estate projects, the key to avoiding disaster relies on several things all going the developers\u2019 way: Connections must be well-maintained, oversight should ideally be avoided, local power structures must be preserved, and the infrastructure needed to breathe life into a remote, self-contained development has to be completed on time. In the case of Anting, the problem seems to be more of an absence of the latter.

European touches, like these yellow phone booths, are everywhere in Spring Legend. (Phoebe Storm)To China\u2019s more bearish observers, vacant cities are prima facie evidence of the country\u2019s overcapacity problem, with Ordos, a \u201cghost town\u201d in Inner Mongolia, being the most famous example. But some economists reject this narrow interpretation. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the \u2018ghost town\u2019 problem is exaggerated.

Bush, but it lapsed in 2007. Now that the Obama administration is negotiating three trade accords \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 nations, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with 28 European countries and a global services pact with about 50 nations \u2014 the White House is eager for the authority. Without such fast-track procedures, agreements could be unraveled by amendments that are anathema to America\u2019s trading partners.The legislation was introduced by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee for ambassador to China; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the committee\u2019s senior Republican; and Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.Soon after the announcement, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, met with reporters and said he would introduce a rival measure giving Congress more say over the final terms of any agreements, given the pitfalls of globalization for American workers. Separately, 151 Democrats have signed a letter signaling opposition, and some Republicans have also spoken against fast-track authority.The White House issued a statement welcoming the legislation, but stopped short of a clear endorsement. Mr. Obama\u2019s trade representative, Michael Froman, said in a separate statement that he anticipated \u201ca robust conversation\u201d with lawmakers \u201cabout how trade agreements should be negotiated and the role of Congress in that process.\u201dThe bill would, for the first time, require provisions against currency manipulation, although the language is aimed at China \u2014 which is not a party to the current Pacific region talks. It would also specify protections for labor, the environment and intellectual property, and guarantee that lawmakers get access to negotiating texts.Mr. Obama, like Mr. Bush and President Bill Clinton before him, faces a struggle to win fast-track power. Many Democrats typically oppose it, along with their allies in labor, environmental and consumer groups, because they do not want to encourage free trade agreements that they say would cost American jobs and create pollution. In recent years more Republicans have turned against trade pacts, to the chagrin of their business supporters. Tea Party sympathizers in particular object that such accords tilt against American products.That political dynamic leaves Mr. Obama at odds with many liberals in his party at a time when his overall support is at a low. Republican leaders are little inclined to help, but for the fact that their businesses allies are eager for free-trade agreements.House leaders will not hold a vote on fast-track legislation unless the White House can produce at least 50 Democratic votes, including at least one party leader\u2019s, said a Republican leadership aide. That is a high hurdle.The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, told reporters, \u201cI made clear to the president that this can\u2019t pass unless there is bipartisan support for it.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2014, on page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Proposal to Give Obama More Say on Trade Accords .

The Abdullah al-Azzam Brigades, an Al Qaeda affiliate with a presence in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the bombing. It said that two \u201cheroes from the heroic Sunnis of Lebanon\u201d carried out the attack and that more bombings would follow until \u201cIran\u2019s party,\u201d meaning Hezbollah, withdraws from Syria, where it is helping defend the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Majed al-Majed, the leader of the Abdullah al-Azzam Brigades, was arrested by the Lebanese authorities last month but <a href=\"/World/Security-Watch/2014/0102/Beirut-car-bomb-Sunni-payback-for-Hezbollah-s-help-to-Assad-video\" target=\"_blank\">died in detention\u00a0on Saturday</a>\u00a0due to a kidney ailment, according to the Lebanese Army.</p><p>Lebanon has a long association with suicide bomb attacks, dating back to 1981, when an unidentified member of Iraq\u2019s Dawa Party blew up the Iraqi embassy in Beirut, but they rarely involved Sunnis.</p><p>Unidentified but suspected Shiite suicide bombers blew up the US Marine barracks, French paratroop headquarters, and US embassy in Beirut in 1983, hastening the departure from Lebanon of a five-nation Western peacekeeping force early the following year. The bulk of the suicide bombings against Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia allies occupying south Lebanon in the 1980s were carried out by Shiites drawn either from Hezbollah or from secular nationalist groups. Only two Lebanese Sunnis committed suicide operations in the 1980s, and both were from leftist organizations and motivated by nationalism rather than religion.</p><p>Furthermore, while car bomb attacks designed to cause maximum casualties in civilian areas of Beirut were a common feature of Lebanon\u2019s 1975-90 civil war, almost all the suicide bombings carried out during that period were against military targets, apart from a handful against diplomatic missions.</p><p>Satem\u2019s suicide bombing was of a different caliber altogether, resembling the indiscriminate sectarian attacks that have killed and wounded thousands of civilians across the <a href=\"/tags/topic/Middle+East\" title=\"Title: Middle East\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Middle East</a> and Asia over the past two decades.</p><p>Most of Lebanon\u2019s Sunnis live on the coast \u2013 Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon \u2013 with scattered communities in the rural periphery in the north, south, and east. For centuries, Lebanese Sunnis have formed the backbone of the merchant classes, thriving under the tutelage of their fellow Sunni Ottomans while other,\u00a0more marginalized\u00a0Levantine sects frequently rebelled. Sunni leaders in Lebanon traditionally favored suits and compromise over military fatigues and dogma.</p><p>But the rising Sunni-Shiite tensions of the past decade, accelerated by the war in Syria, is steadily radicalizing Lebanese Sunnis, particularly in poorer areas of the country long neglected by the Lebanese state \u2013 like Satem's Hnayder and surrounding villages in the Wadi Khaled area of northern Lebanon.</p><a name=\"eztoc17773477_2\" id=\"eztoc17773477_2\"/><h2>Troubling details</h2><p>The news of Satem\u2019s violent death in southern Beirut has been greeted in Wadi Khaled with a mix of pride, disgust, and denial.\u00a0While Anwar and several other residents from the area quietly praised Satem\u2019s suicide attack, others were less supportive.</p><p>\u201cWhat he did was wrong and I am against it. We have lived with Shiites and Alawites [a splinter sect of Shiite Islam] for centuries, and this bombing will only make the situation worse,\u201d says Mohammed, who like most of the people who agreed to talk in Wadi Khaled did so on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.</p><p>Wadi Khaled, a hammer-shaped peninsula of Lebanese territory jutting into Syria, is under tight control by the Lebanese Army and security forces with military checkpoints on all roads accessing the area.</p><p>Mohammed said he knew Satem from their school days and remembered him as a moderate young man. He was studying engineering at a university in north Lebanon and was said to help his father in his clothing shop.</p><p>Sheikh Imad Malabas, a cleric in Wadi Khaled who follows the austere Salafist credo of Sunni Islam, also claims to have known Satem well. \u201cI can assure you that Qutaiba did not have the extremist ideology of Al Qaeda,\u201d says the thickly bearded cleric, sitting in the sunlit courtyard of his home.</p><p>Some reports said Satem traveled to Syria two months ago to join a rebel group and fought in the town of Yabroud in the mountainous Qalamoun region north of Damascus where Hezbollah is spearheading a campaign to restore regime control. But Sheikh Malabas and other residents of Wadi Khaled claimed that Satem went missing only four days before his death. They said that Satem did not know how to drive and question how his relatively unscathed identification card was so quickly discovered at the scene of the bombing.</p><p>\u201cNo one in their right mind would take their ID card with them on such a mission. All the evidence against Satem was neatly laid out on the road,\u201d the sheikh says.</p><p>While Sheikh Malabas does not dispute that Satem was in the vehicle, he insists that the young student was kidnapped by Hezbollah and drugged, and that the bomb was detonated by remote control.</p><p>However, the surveillance camera footage shown on Hezbollah\u2019s Al Manar television channel suggests otherwise. Satem\u2019s vehicle is seen moving slowly along the street followed by a school bus. He drives past the fortified entrance to Hezbollah\u2019s political office before veering to the right as if looking to park. He continues on, and seconds later his vehicle disappears in a ball of fire. The driver of the school bus, which was empty of children, was among the victims of the blast.</p><a name=\"eztoc17773477_3\" id=\"eztoc17773477_3\"/><h2>Worried communities</h2><p>Satem was buried\u00a0on Saturday\u00a0night in a cemetery in Hnayder, where a string of small houses flank a potholed road surrounded by fields studded with basalt boulders. A chill breeze whipped across the flat landscape\u00a0Monday\u00a0as dozens of male residents bundled up in baggy black leather jackets and coats gathered at the home of Satem\u2019s father, Mohammed, to give condolences. Beneath a canvas awning in the front yard, platters of rice, fish, and lamb were laid out on trestle tables for the mourners.</p><p>In the gloomy interior of the house, subdued elderly men, many with red and white keffiyehs wrapped around their heads, sat against walls muttering quietly and smoking cigarettes. Two brass coffee pots rested on a bed of coals while a third was used to pour bitter Arabic coffee into tiny handless cups for each arriving mourner.</p><p>\u201cWe are against what happened and we are against extremism,\u201d Mohammed Satem says in a tired voice. \u201cI cannot say more, but we think there is a question mark over what happened that needs to be answered.\u201d</p><a name=\"eztoc17773477_4\" id=\"eztoc17773477_4\"/><h2>Back in Beirut</h2><p>The suicide bombing has cast a chill across the mainly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. It was the first suicide bomb attack to target civilians in the area, but it was the fourth car bombing in southern Beirut since last July,\u00a0indicating\u00a0to many residents that this is a pattern that will not stop.</p><p>\u201cPeople are moving out. The streets are empty. People are very worried,\u201d says one resident of Haret Hreik.</p><p>Hezbollah, however, remains publicly undaunted and determined to continue its mission of defending the Assad regime against what it dubs as Takfiris \u2013extremist Sunnis who treat all those that do not follow their brand of Islam as apostates.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what the size of crimes and car bombs reached, we will not change our position in Syria or in Lebanon,\u201d said Sheikh Nabil Qaouk, a top Hezbollah official at a funeral\u00a0on Monday\u00a0for two victims of the suicide bombing. \u201cWe are the makers of victories in any war we fight and we are not those who leave the battlefield or surrender no matter how massive is the bombing.\u201d</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p id=\"ndn-video-single-02\" class=\"ndn-widget\"/>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"p402_hide\"/>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n</div></body></html>", "title": "The Syria effect: Lebanese Sunnis begin to strap on bombs (+video)", "updated": "", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2014/0107/The-Syria-effect-Lebanese-Sunnis-begin-to-strap-on-bombs-video", "_id": 310646597, "source": "http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world", "text": "Lebanon's moderate Sunni community is radicalizing, as shown by last week's suicide bombing in Beirut.

It said that two \u201cheroes from the heroic Sunnis of Lebanon\u201d carried out the attack and that more bombings would follow until \u201cIran\u2019s party,\u201d meaning Hezbollah, withdraws from Syria, where it is helping defend the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Majed al-Majed, the leader of the Abdullah al-Azzam Brigades, was arrested by the Lebanese authorities last month but died in detention on Saturday due to a kidney ailment, according to the Lebanese Army.Lebanon has a long association with suicide bomb attacks, dating back to 1981, when an unidentified member of Iraq\u2019s Dawa Party blew up the Iraqi embassy in Beirut, but they rarely involved Sunnis.Unidentified but suspected Shiite suicide bombers blew up the US Marine barracks, French paratroop headquarters, and US embassy in Beirut in 1983, hastening the departure from Lebanon of a five-nation Western peacekeeping force early the following year. The bulk of the suicide bombings against Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia allies occupying south Lebanon in the 1980s were carried out by Shiites drawn either from Hezbollah or from secular nationalist groups. Only two Lebanese Sunnis committed suicide operations in the 1980s, and both were from leftist organizations and motivated by nationalism rather than religion.Furthermore, while car bomb attacks designed to cause maximum casualties in civilian areas of Beirut were a common feature of Lebanon\u2019s 1975-90 civil war, almost all the suicide bombings carried out during that period were against military targets, apart from a handful against diplomatic missions.Satem\u2019s suicide bombing was of a different caliber altogether, resembling the indiscriminate sectarian attacks that have killed and wounded thousands of civilians across the Middle East and Asia over the past two decades.Most of Lebanon\u2019s Sunnis live on the coast \u2013 Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon \u2013 with scattered communities in the rural periphery in the north, south, and east. For centuries, Lebanese Sunnis have formed the backbone of the merchant classes, thriving under the tutelage of their fellow Sunni Ottomans while other, more marginalized Levantine sects frequently rebelled. Sunni leaders in Lebanon traditionally favored suits and compromise over military fatigues and dogma.But the rising Sunni-Shiite tensions of the past decade, accelerated by the war in Syria, is steadily radicalizing Lebanese Sunnis, particularly in poorer areas of the country long neglected by the Lebanese state \u2013 like Satem's Hnayder and surrounding villages in the Wadi Khaled area of northern Lebanon.Troubling detailsThe news of Satem\u2019s violent death in southern Beirut has been greeted in Wadi Khaled with a mix of pride, disgust, and denial. While Anwar and several other residents from the area quietly praised Satem\u2019s suicide attack, others were less supportive.\u201cWhat he did was wrong and I am against it. We have lived with Shiites and Alawites [a splinter sect of Shiite Islam] for centuries, and this bombing will only make the situation worse,\u201d says Mohammed, who like most of the people who agreed to talk in Wadi Khaled did so on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.Wadi Khaled, a hammer-shaped peninsula of Lebanese territory jutting into Syria, is under tight control by the Lebanese Army and security forces with military checkpoints on all roads accessing the area.Mohammed said he knew Satem from their school days and remembered him as a moderate young man. He was studying engineering at a university in north Lebanon and was said to help his father in his clothing shop.Sheikh Imad Malabas, a cleric in Wadi Khaled who follows the austere Salafist credo of Sunni Islam, also claims to have known Satem well. \u201cI can assure you that Qutaiba did not have the extremist ideology of Al Qaeda,\u201d says the thickly bearded cleric, sitting in the sunlit courtyard of his home.Some reports said Satem traveled to Syria two months ago to join a rebel group and fought in the town of Yabroud in the mountainous Qalamoun region north of Damascus where Hezbollah is spearheading a campaign to restore regime control. But Sheikh Malabas and other residents of Wadi Khaled claimed that Satem went missing only four days before his death. They said that Satem did not know how to drive and question how his relatively unscathed identification card was so quickly discovered at the scene of the bombing.\u201cNo one in their right mind would take their ID card with them on such a mission. All the evidence against Satem was neatly laid out on the road,\u201d the sheikh says.While Sheikh Malabas does not dispute that Satem was in the vehicle, he insists that the young student was kidnapped by Hezbollah and drugged, and that the bomb was detonated by remote control.However, the surveillance camera footage shown on Hezbollah\u2019s Al Manar television channel suggests otherwise. Satem\u2019s vehicle is seen moving slowly along the street followed by a school bus. He drives past the fortified entrance to Hezbollah\u2019s political office before veering to the right as if looking to park. He continues on, and seconds later his vehicle disappears in a ball of fire. The driver of the school bus, which was empty of children, was among the victims of the blast.Worried communitiesSatem was buried on Saturday night in a cemetery in Hnayder, where a string of small houses flank a potholed road surrounded by fields studded with basalt boulders. A chill breeze whipped across the flat landscape Monday as dozens of male residents bundled up in baggy black leather jackets and coats gathered at the home of Satem\u2019s father, Mohammed, to give condolences. Beneath a canvas awning in the front yard, platters of rice, fish, and lamb were laid out on trestle tables for the mourners.In the gloomy interior of the house, subdued elderly men, many with red and white keffiyehs wrapped around their heads, sat against walls muttering quietly and smoking cigarettes. Two brass coffee pots rested on a bed of coals while a third was used to pour bitter Arabic coffee into tiny handless cups for each arriving mourner.\u201cWe are against what happened and we are against extremism,\u201d Mohammed Satem says in a tired voice. \u201cI cannot say more, but we think there is a question mark over what happened that needs to be answered.\u201dBack in BeirutThe suicide bombing has cast a chill across the mainly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. It was the first suicide bomb attack to target civilians in the area, but it was the fourth car bombing in southern Beirut since last July, indicating to many residents that this is a pattern that will not stop.\u201cPeople are moving out. The streets are empty. People are very worried,\u201d says one resident of Haret Hreik.Hezbollah, however, remains publicly undaunted and determined to continue its mission of defending the Assad regime against what it dubs as Takfiris \u2013extremist Sunnis who treat all those that do not follow their brand of Islam as apostates.\u201cNo matter what the size of crimes and car bombs reached, we will not change our position in Syria or in Lebanon,\u201d said Sheikh Nabil Qaouk, a top Hezbollah official at a funeral on Monday for two victims of the suicide bombing. \u201cWe are the makers of victories in any war we fight and we are not those who leave the battlefield or surrender no matter how massive is the bombing.\u201d", "published": "", "tags": null}, {"author": "Reena Flores", "html": "<html><body><div><section id=\"articleBody\">&#13;\n\t<p>&#13;\n\t\tA recent court <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/technology/court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-20140114\" target=\"_blank\">ruling</a> striking down net neutrality has the Internet reeling.

Many Americans might not realize it, but their members of Congress, when they're in <a href=\"/tags/topic/Washington%2c+DC\" title=\"Title: Washington, DC\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Washington</a>, generally work only three days a week. House and Senate leaders brief reporters on what\u2019s ahead on Tuesdays, give wrap-up press conferences on Thursdays, and then, like the Nike swoosh logo, they\u2019re outta here.</p><p>\u201cWe have to learn how to put in a decent week\u2019s worth of work on the floor again,\u201d Senate minority leader <a href=\"/tags/topic/Mitch+McConnell\" title=\"Title: Mitch McConnell\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mitch McConnell</a> (R) of Kentucky urged from the chamber this month. He was speaking about how the increasingly divisive Senate needs to change its ways, and he\u2019s not alone in his views.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Many lawmakers and observers believe that if members of Congress didn\u2019t skip town so often, partisan tensions would ease and more work would get done. Last year was the least productive, as measured by legislation enacted, since World War II.</p><p>These extollers of the \u201cgood old days\u201d remember when lawmakers actually lived full-time in the D.C.-area with their families, instead of doubling-and-tripling up for a few days in town houses on <a href=\"/tags/topic/Capitol+Hill\" title=\"Title: Capitol Hill\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capitol Hill</a>. They showed up at the same soccer games to cheer on their kids, barbecued on weekends, and had many more opportunities to socialize with each other across party lines. <b>\u00a0</b></p><p>Not long ago, congressional committees produced the lion\u2019s share of legislation, and members of both parties had to work with each other on it. But today, a lot of the legislation originates in the leaders\u2019 offices, diminishing the role of committees.</p><p>All this matters because it\u2019s harder to demonize your opponents when you know them, and knowing them allows for more effective legislating \u2013 itself a time-consuming process. For most members, the House gym is one of the last places where Republicans and <a href=\"/tags/topic/U.S.+Democratic+Party\" title=\"Title: U.S. Democratic Party\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Democrats</a> still mix casually.</p><p>Some members of Congress are trying to bring back the old collegiality. Rep. Luke Messer (R) of <a href=\"/tags/topic/Indiana\" title=\"Title: Indiana\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indiana</a> is president of the <a href=\"/tags/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party\" title=\"Title: U.S. Republican Party\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">GOP</a> freshman class in the House. Unusually, he moved his family to Washington. (<a href=\"http://thehill.com/capital-living/new-member-of-the-week/195187-messer-wants-more-empathetic-gop\" target=\"_blank\">The Hill reports</a> that he sometimes has his office television playing cartoons for his children.) He has hosted family get-togethers with Democrats who have also moved their families to the area.</p><p>Olympia Snowe, the former Republican senator from Maine, also urges more time in Washington in her 2013 book \u201cFighting for Common Ground.\u201d If Congress returned to the five-day work week, took fewer breaks, and synchronized the House and Senate schedules (they overlapped by only one week in the crucial rush-to-the-finish-line month of December), then representatives and senators would have more time and tamer temperaments \u201cto address the critical issues,\u201d she argues.</p><p>But the rhythm of Congress also has a history \u2013 and logic \u2013 that pushes against such reforms.</p><p>Scheduling has changed drastically over the decades. From 1789 until the 1930s, Congress met during the first five or six months of the year, and that was it. By the 1960s, that schedule had expanded well into the fall, and in 1963, the Senate met the entire year with no break longer than a three-day weekend, says Betty Koed, the Senate\u2019s associate historian. It was so bad that the late majority leader Mike Mansfield (D) of Montana, commented that he no longer recognized his wife during daylight hours.

Not Congress \u2013 settled into a routine of long breaks and a three-day-workweek. Lawmakers would get more done if they spent more time in Washington, some reformers say. Most Americans who have MLK Day off will return to their jobs tomorrow. Not Congress. It\u2019s taking the whole week off \u2013 the mid-January break \u2013 to be followed by the mid-February break, another recess in March, and so on through the months until August, which is completely free. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition And that\u2019s not all. Many Americans might not realize it, but their members of Congress, when they're in Washington, generally work only three days a week. House and Senate leaders brief reporters on what\u2019s ahead on Tuesdays, give wrap-up press conferences on Thursdays, and then, like the Nike swoosh logo, they\u2019re outta here.\u201cWe have to learn how to put in a decent week\u2019s worth of work on the floor again,\u201d Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky urged from the chamber this month. He was speaking about how the increasingly divisive Senate needs to change its ways, and he\u2019s not alone in his views. Many lawmakers and observers believe that if members of Congress didn\u2019t skip town so often, partisan tensions would ease and more work would get done. Last year was the least productive, as measured by legislation enacted, since World War II.These extollers of the \u201cgood old days\u201d remember when lawmakers actually lived full-time in the D.C.-area with their families, instead of doubling-and-tripling up for a few days in town houses on Capitol Hill. They showed up at the same soccer games to cheer on their kids, barbecued on weekends, and had many more opportunities to socialize with each other across party lines. Not long ago, congressional committees produced the lion\u2019s share of legislation, and members of both parties had to work with each other on it. But today, a lot of the legislation originates in the leaders\u2019 offices, diminishing the role of committees.All this matters because it\u2019s harder to demonize your opponents when you know them, and knowing them allows for more effective legislating \u2013 itself a time-consuming process. For most members, the House gym is one of the last places where Republicans and Democrats still mix casually.Some members of Congress are trying to bring back the old collegiality. Rep. Luke Messer (R) of Indiana is president of the GOP freshman class in the House. Unusually, he moved his family to Washington. (The Hill reports that he sometimes has his office television playing cartoons for his children.) He has hosted family get-togethers with Democrats who have also moved their families to the area.Olympia Snowe, the former Republican senator from Maine, also urges more time in Washington in her 2013 book \u201cFighting for Common Ground.\u201d If Congress returned to the five-day work week, took fewer breaks, and synchronized the House and Senate schedules (they overlapped by only one week in the crucial rush-to-the-finish-line month of December), then representatives and senators would have more time and tamer temperaments \u201cto address the critical issues,\u201d she argues.But the rhythm of Congress also has a history \u2013 and logic \u2013 that pushes against such reforms.Scheduling has changed drastically over the decades. From 1789 until the 1930s, Congress met during the first five or six months of the year, and that was it. By the 1960s, that schedule had expanded well into the fall, and in 1963, the Senate met the entire year with no break longer than a three-day weekend, says Betty Koed, the Senate\u2019s associate historian. It was so bad that the late majority leader Mike Mansfield (D) of Montana, commented that he no longer recognized his wife during daylight hours. In 1970, Congress bowed to the member pressure to ease the long sessions and scorching summers and adopted, by law, the August recess. Cultural pressures in the 1990s largely shaped today\u2019s commuter schedule: Spouses, mostly wives, began to have careers of their own and didn\u2019t want to move to the nation\u2019s capital, or to uproot their children. The perpetual campaign required members to be in their districts more, even as the reputation of Washington sank, making absence a political plus. Neither the House nor Senate generally schedules any meaningful votes on Mondays or Fridays, so that members \u2013 especially those from far-away states \u2013 can travel back to their homes each week.Meanwhile, the Internet allows lawmakers to be in touch from wherever. \u201cSenate jobs are 24/7 and go with you wherever you go,\u201d says Ms. Koed. \u201cIt\u2019s misleading,\u201d she adds, to give the impression that because members of Congress are not physically on Capitol Hill, they\u2019re not working. Members don\u2019t consider a week back home as a break. On the official House calendar, it\u2019s called a \u201cconstituent work week.\u201d Usually, the time home is packed with town halls and other events. Representative Messer, for instance, had 17 events scheduled in 48 hours over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.Of course, there\u2019s work and there\u2019s work. Former Rep.

He has emphatically insisted that he did nothing illegal in his interactions with businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. and made no agreements to assist his company, Star Scientific Inc.It also provides a vivid illustration of the extent to which both of the McDonnells believe that it was the former first lady\u2019s poor judgment in establishing a friendship with Williams that has landed the couple in legal peril.Attorneys for the couple, who have said their clients are innocent, declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office also declined to comment.A plea deal would have allowed the McDonnells to avoid the release of embarrassing details in an indictment as well as a bruising public trial that will probably put the internal dynamics of their marriage on full display.Robert McDonnell has said publicly that he was not aware of all of the gifts his family accepted from Williams in 2011 and 2012.People familiar with the investigation say that in private meetings, the couple\u2019s attorneys have told prosecutors that Maureen McDonnell at times actively worked to hide Williams\u2019s generosity from her husband.In court, that idea will be tested against the reality of the couple\u2019s relationship as jurors are asked to assess whether they believe the former governor could have been in the dark about Williams\u2019s largesse and his wife\u2019s activities to help Star Scientific.Williams\u2019s gifts included a Rolex watch inscribed \u201c71st Governor of Virginia\u201d that prosecutors say Maureen McDonnell requested in 2011 to later give her husband for Christmas.The indictment includes more examples of actions she allegedly took on behalf of Star Scientific than did her husband.While the governor set up meetings for Williams with top state officials and attended an event at the Executive Mansion to mark the launch of Star Scientific\u2019s supplement Anatabloc, prosecutors say Maureen McDonnell told Williams in May 2011 that she could help the company if he provided the couple financial assistance.He then lent her $50,000. Later, he lent $70,000 to a small real estate company owned by the governor and his sister.Maureen McDonnell attended a number of Star events with investors, including events in Florida and Michigan.

The infamous episode of your ABC show <em>Politically Incorrect</em>, on September 17, 2001\u2014</strong></p>\n\n<p>The tragic events of 9/17?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes, The tragic events of 9/17. [Ed. note: Maher said, in response to President George W. Bush's comment that the 9/11 hijackers were cowards, \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly.\" Advertisers withdrew and the show was cancelled a few months later.] You've said the aftermath of that was the most traumatic period of your life. So I'm curious, what has it been like moving over to HBO, where there are no advertisers? And, second, why does everyone forget that when you made your remarks, you were just agreeing with a guest, Dinesh D'Souza?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, I had Dinesh on our show last season, and brought that up to him. You know, I was just agreeing with what he said. I was concurring, as a good host does, you know? And maybe extrapolating a little. But yeah, I could have used a little cover from Mr. D'Souza.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you tired of talking about the events of 9/17?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No!</p>\n\n<p><strong>It's now been 13 years. Do you feel like HBO has your back in a way that ABC did not?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Absolutely. They always have. And, of course, let's be honest, it's easier for them to have my back because they don't have to deal with advertisers. You know, I was never mad at ABC for firing me. I totally understood that I was on a broadcast medium that depends on advertisers, and if the advertisers pull out there's really not much you can do. I was only pissed at them because they lied about it. They said we lost our audience and we never did! We always had good ratings, and we retained good ratings, and very high retention ratings from <em>Nightline</em>. It took a long time for Jimmy Kimmel to come up to the ratings that we used to get in that timeslot. So, that was the only thing that pissed me off about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You're a comedian. But <em>Real Time</em> is somewhere between a pure comedy show and, say, <em>Morning Joe</em>. When you sit down to write your show, are you thinking that your job is to generate laughs, or are you trying to convey a perspective on the news? It's been observed that many young people now get their news from <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Colbert Report</em>. Who's your intended audience, and what are you trying to communicate to them?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Part of it is what you just attributed to those other two shows. You said people get their news from those two shows, but I'm guessing at least as many people watch my show. So, I think I'm trying to do the same thing. Give people news. The main thing I'm thinking of, because we are after all a weekly wrap-up show, is I'm doing this show for people who are interested in the news, but don't have time to follow it like I do. They have lives. They have kids. They have jobs. They can't read the paper every day. So, Friday night at 10 o'clock when they sit down in front of the television set, I want them to be able to feel as they watch it\u2014an hour of <em>Real Time</em>\u2014in one section of the show, either the monologue, in the New Rules, in the panel, in one of the one-on-one interviews\u2014I want them to feel like every important issue, or at least what I feel is important, that happened that week got in some way mentioned. And then, of course, I do want to make it as entertaining as possible. And we have enough prewritten stuff that I know there's always going to be laughs throughout the show. And the panel is lively too, but the panel, you know I have no control over what three other people say, or how amusing they're going to be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you view Stewart and Colbert? Do you see what you're doing as kind of comparable to what they're doing? Or are you doing something different?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm more comparable to them than to, say, <em>Dancing With the Stars</em>. But I see vast differences. I don't think we're as predictable. I will disagree with my liberal audience. I will challenge them. Sometimes I'll even yell at them. I'm real about it. I treat the audience like real friends, and sometimes we argue. And sometimes they need to be educated about something. Sometimes liberals can be in a bubble too. And, you know, there's just a host of issues that I think our show and the old show has been out front on, that are more and more becoming mainstream. Things like atheism and marijuana legalization\u2014but not just those\u2014that I've been talking about for years; somehow things get into the mainstream after somebody has been pounding away on it for a long time. And then they just seem normal.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">\"I remember talking to a lot of liberal people who were saying Obama's reelection is in the bag. And I said, you know you don't get outside of your circle of people. Out there in America, it's not in the bag!\"</aside><p><strong>You famously gave a million dollars of your own money to the pro-Obama super PAC. From the perspective of where we are now, do you feel that was money well spent?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you look at what the alternative universe would be under a Mitt Romney presidency, I think it's money very well spent. There's not an issue I can think of where Mitt Romney would be better. And I can only imagine what sort of cavalcade of nutcases would have followed him into Washington. Because he basically promised his soul to those hard-right groups that control the party now. And Mitt Romney never has had much of a backbone. So I'm very happy with that, because I did some research on it and it seemed to make a difference. At least that's what the people who run the PACs\u2014like Paul Begala\u2014have told me. Until we had that little bit of publicity, the big-money people on the left were kind of sitting on their hands. I got scared at that point, because I remember talking to a lot of liberal people who were saying Obama's reelection is in the bag. And I said, you know you don't get outside of your circle of people. Out there in America, it's not in the bag! Not in the bag at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you characterize yourself politically?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think everybody thinks they make sense. I don't see issues ideologically. I see what makes sense. You know, I've tried to identify this new category called \"the 9/11 liberal,\" because after 9/11 there was a category that sprung up called \"9/11 conservatives.\" These were people like Dennis Miller, who became very, very conservative. Ron Silver was another one. We were all freaked out by 9/11, as we should be. It was a horrendous attack. But I think at a certain point, the liberals turned a blind eye to the singular threat that is radical Islam. This is something I've had a lot of problems with my liberal audience over, and we talk about it quite frequently on the show. That's a good example of something where I just think it makes common sense, and if you don't understand that there are disturbing percentages, often majorities of people across the Muslim world, who believe in things that are anything but liberal. You know, rule of law isn't just different than theocracy. It's better. Free speech, respect for minorities, and equality of women. Separation of church and state, freedom to practice any religion you want, or none, without the threat of violence. All of these issues, if anyone in their own country stood up against, the liberals would be incensed about. But somehow because they see Muslims as a minority, they want to defend them for the very things that are illiberal. I hold a number of positions that I think would be seen as conservative\u2014but, again, I don't see them as liberal or conservative. I see them as \"that's what I think makes sense.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speaking of Dennis Miller, what happened to him? Did 9/11 break him?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, I've never been a close friend of Dennis's. We've been colleagues for many years. Dennis is a very private guy, but we certainly were friendly. We shared the same manager for 30 years. And I'm a fan of Dennis as a comedian. I think he's a terrific kind of comedian. He really knows how to practice the art of standup comedy. That being said, yeah, he became a lot more conservative. I understood the national-security side of it. That's the \"9/11 conservative\" moniker that was hung on him and some other people, and that makes sense. What I didn't understand was why he became a down-the-line right-wing conservative on a number of issues. He's Fox News's go-to guy now. Maybe it's just the money, you know. People want to work, and he found an audience. But it doesn't really follow that you have to be conservative on every issue just because of 9/11. I cannot tell you what goes on in Dennis Miller's mind, and people ask me that all the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It seems to be what happened to David Mamet too.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That I think is religion. David Mamet is seriously influenced by religion. Very orthodox religion. And religion warps thinking. It's impossible to worship superstition on Sunday or Saturday and just be a normal person every other day of the week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another area where you've sort of broken faith with the liberal conventional thinking is on the right of the NSA to be collecting all this metadata in the service of protecting us from what could be a really horrible nuclear catastrophe. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?</strong></p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">Franklin didn't live in the 21st century. The worst that could've happened in his era is that the gunpowder blew up, or the musket went off. We live in a very different era.</aside><p>I never said that I was outright in support of the NSA. I'm certainly on the page of most Americans in that we need to know more. I think Edward Snowden did the country a great service by opening up this can of worms. What I did say in one of our editorials that we did this year is I used the quote that so often is bandied about in the media by Benjamin Franklin who said that those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither. Well, Franklin didn't live in the 21st century. Franklin didn't live in post-nuclear-weapons times. The worst that could've happened in his era is that the gunpowder blew up, or the musket went off. We live in a very different era, and I live very close to the port of Long Beach, and the port of Los Angeles, where almost half of the cargo comes in. It'd be a very likely place for them to sneak in a dirty bomb. My day would be much more ruined a dirty bomb going off than it would by the NSA knowing when I masturbate. Now I don't think the NSA should know when I masturbate, but I'm just saying, we live in different times than when Benjamin Franklin said that, so let's get real. What I did say is, I am willing to give up some liberty for some security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If the NSA's knowing when you masturbate was directly correlated with their ability to stop an attack, that would probably be okay, right?</strong></p>\n\n<p>[Laughs] That would be okay, yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I was looking at your standup schedule for the next couple of months: Mobile, Alabama; Corpus Christi, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Birmingham, Alabama. Do you have a death wish? Or are you trying to find the liberals there or are you trying to speak to the red staters? What's your goal in picking those venues as opposed to on the East or West Coast where it would be easy to sell out theaters?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, but I can sell them out in Corpus Christi and Mobile too. The thing is, I don't have to seek out the liberals in those cities. When I come to town, they seek me out. I guess we're seeking each other out. I've learned this over the last 10 or 15 years. There are so many liberal people in conservative areas. There's a lot of reasons why people live where they live, and it's not often, or certainly not always, because that's where they're politically aligned. So there's lots of progressive, free-thinking, liberal people in all these states, and what makes it so fun to go to red areas, if you will, is that those people there are so, I think, gratified that I didn't write off the whole state, go \"Alabama, I would never go there!\" No, I understand that there are smart people living in Alabama. Yes, they're surrounded by a bunch of rednecks, but when I come to town, there's something more magical than when I go to San Francisco or New York, which is predictably liberal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And do you find that the people who turn out are, as it were, the liberal base? Or do you get more hecklers?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Oh, no \u2026 I mean, I do see sometimes there's very often somebody in the front row scowling at me with his arms folded, but that's invariably a husband who was dragged there by his wife.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I've seen you talk about how 25 years ago, there were Republicans you respected\u2014like Bob Dole, Howard Baker. Who in the Republican Party now, if anybody, do you respect?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Oh, that's a great question. [Laughs] I don't know, do you have a few minutes while I think that over? I mean, name some people, and I'll try to\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Joe Scarborough?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Um, yeah, Joe is more of an honest broker. Joe will attack his own party, which I think is the key. You have to be willing to, just like when you're an artist, edit your own best jokes, or you make an album and you cut 16 tracks and you gotta take away four. You gotta be able to kill your own children. That's the same thing with politics. You have to be able to be ruthlessly self-critical and turn on your own people. I've seen Joe do that, so yeah, whenever somebody does that, I do respect them. What I do not like is people who just know how to cheer for their own team. That's the problem I have, again, sometimes with my studio audience in L.A. They only know to cheer for the blue team and boo for the red team. And it's not as simple as that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How about John McCain, who's intermittently maverick?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Right. John McCain, it's almost like alternate side of the street parking. One day, he kind of takes hits and reminds you of the old maverick John McCain from 2000, the guy we all liked so much. And then he's also capable of just being as bad as anybody in the Senate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How about John Boehner?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. What? John Boehner? Very recently, I think he's got fed up with the Tea Party finally and maybe has shown signs of bucking them. But until very recently, this is the guy who wouldn't call votes because he was afraid of the Tea Party. He's not exactly been a profile in courage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would you characterize your foreign policy? You came out after being an ardent opponent of Iraq, but supported the Libyan intervention. Are you a liberal interventionist or a realist?</strong></p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">\"I'd love to see us end the empire.\u00a0Can we get the troops out of Germany and Japan? Jesus Christ, how long do these wars have to be over? Do we ever end anything?\"</aside><p>Number one is I'd love to see us end the empire. And stop getting into every war that comes along. If you Google \"wars in America,\" I think that in 216 of our 237 years, we've been at it with somebody. At some point you gotta look in the mirror and say, \"Maybe it's me.\" Of course, this is because our defense industry, as Eisenhower warned 50 years ago, warning us about this idea that we have to watch out for this greedy maw that is the military-industrial complex. Of course we're always in a war, because we create endless amounts of armaments that have to be used up somehow. I think if you take the 13 countries who spend the most behind us on defense, and you add up everything they spend, we still spend more than all of them combined. That's insane. Even deficit hawks like Paul Ryan want to add $500 billion more to the defense budget, which is already the most bloated part of the budget. So that's number one. Can we get the troops out of Germany and Japan? Jesus Christ, how long do these wars have to be over? Do we ever end anything? I think that would solve so much in this country if we stopped having an empire and stopped spending so much money on blowing shit up. And then, to be smart about the war on terror, which I think Obama has been much more than Bush was. It's not a war that needs to be fought with armies, and cannot be won with armies. It's a war that needs to be waged with good police work and spy work. And that's more of how we're doing it now. If you want to ask me about drones, yeah, drones do some bad things, but again there are no great answers to this war. I'd rather fight the war with drones than with armies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your view of Obama now? I know you've expressed disappointment with him on some issues. How would you grade him a year into his second term? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, I always grade him with an eye to knowing that there was probably no president in history that had more opposition, irrational opposition, to everything he tried to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>By irrational, do you mean racist?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Absolutely, racist. We all remember that as soon as he was elected, Mitch McConnell, and Boehner, they all had a meeting and they said they would not, in any way, support anything that had President Blackula's bite marks on it. You know, he's had to deal with that from the beginning. Yes, it is racial. I know that's the one thing that they hate to be called. They just cannot stand to be called racist. Okay, but let's look at the facts. So much of what he has done is the exact thing they asked him to do. He lowered taxes. That was the first thing he did, he lowered everybody's taxes. A third of the stimulus package that they hated so much was a tax cut. You'd think a party that's called \"taxed enough already,\" that's all about lowering taxes, would've liked that. Nope. When they did polls, over 90 percent of Teabaggers didn't even know he did that. He cut the deficit in half! He has shrunk the size of government and reduced the number of government workers, something Bush never did. The stock market has more than doubled. And yet they still don't like him. I can't put my finger on what it is, but it's certainly not his record. If they think he's a socialist, they really need to think again because he's not even a liberal. He's got Mitt Romney's healthcare plan and George W. Bush's foreign policy. What do they want from the guy?</p>\n\n<p><strong>So you don't think it's his policies that cause him problems?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's personal. Who was the guy who said, was it Pete Sessions, was that the congressman, the Republican, who said, \"I cannot stand to be in the same room with him?\" [Ed. note: Democratic Senator Dick Durbin claimed Sessions told Obama, \"I cannot even stand to look at you,\" though Sessions and the White House denied it happened.]</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">\"[Obama]'s got Mitt Romney's healthcare plan and George W.

They hated Clinton, but they never said anything like that about Clinton, that they couldn't stand to be in the same room with him, and his cum was on the furniture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How delicious do you find the prospect of a Hillary presidency or at least a White House with Bill Clinton rattling around as first husband? How do you balance your excitement about that as a comedian versus your enthusiasm for\u2014or terror about\u2014the politics of it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am not afraid of Hillary as president. She is really smart and very capable obviously. Unfortunately the Clintons are centrist Democrats, they are corporate, centrist Democrats. They are in a lot of ways part of the problem, a lot of our problems that we face now are because in the \u201890s the Democrat Party gave up on being the liberal party. And a lot of that was Bill Clinton. Glass-Steagall was repealed under Clinton. [Robert] Rubin was the treasury secretary and you were left with a country that did not have a left party. And we still don't. We have a far-right party, and we basically have a center-right party. And we don't have a left-wing party. That is why things like Obamacare are really Republican plans that were repackaged\u2014and as soon as Obama put his name on it, they didn't like it, but it is really Bob Dole's old plan. Or cap and trade! Cap and trade is somehow the Democratic response to global warming now, whereas 20 years ago, that was George [H.W.] Bush's plan to fight acid rain. So you know I am not thrilled with a Clinton presidency, but as a comedian, yes, Hillary and Bill Clinton are always going to be good for comedy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who would thrill you politically in 2016 from either party?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Elizabeth Warren would be somebody I would be very excited about. A true Democrat, a true progressive, and somebody who I think has the right ideas about everything. I love her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obviously everybody knows your staunchly atheist views. But do you ever think about Pascal's wager, which is that, as crazy as a lot of religious doctrine may seem, and as bad as it can make people behave, what if you're wrong and you're dooming yourself to eternity in hell? Do you worry about that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of all the reasons to be religious, that is the one of the dumber ones. What if I'm wrong? If it is the God of the Old Testament, I am so fucked already, and you and everybody else. A more psychopathic character you will not ever find in fiction. Just the idea that people worshipped the God of this Bible is insane. There is no more psychopathic mass murderer than God, so good luck with worrying that you picked the wrong religion, you're going to suffer for it. As far as the question of how do we know? No, we don't know. Am I a billion percent sure? Nobody is a billion percent sure of anything. I don't know how it all began, no one does. But I am pretty sure it's not that God had a son. [laughs] You know he's this orb of perfect energy, this powerful beyond imagination, but he's got kids. That would drive him fucking nuts, let me tell you. So you know we don't know the answers but the answer to that is not to make up stories. If you don't know something, just say, I don't know. That's your gospel right there. The gospel of \"I don't know.\" I combined apathy and atheist, and I came up with apatheist. I don't know what happens when I die, and I don't care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is your primary goal to get people to laugh or to get them to think?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have never been interested\u2014even when I was a young comic starting out\u2014in material that didn't have some bite to it. That didn't have some nutrition to it. I never did the \"men do this, and women do this, and dogs and cats.\" Jerry Seinfeld is a genius because he can talk about trivial subjects in a way that everyone will know what he's talking about and the most intelligent people are not insulted at all and are in fact delighted. But I am not that guy. I always wanted to talk about stuff that mattered. So if my joke doesn't have some meaning behind it, I am not going to be doing that, I am not going to be interested in that subject anyway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You're a George Carlin admirer.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, Carlin was pretty much the same way. But Carlin would do 20 brilliant minutes on society and then 10 minutes on farting. He mixed it up. I don't. I just do the society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's the significance of being over 50?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just think when you're under 50, and of course you're stretching it a little into your 40s, it's okay to sort of play that, hey, I'm the swinging-bachelor type. And we did used to do jokes on <em>Politically Incorrect</em>, and maybe on the early years of <em>Real Time</em>, that ended with me in the hot tub with twins or something. There were some of those punch lines. I just think when you're over 50, I can't explain it, maybe it's not logical, but I just think it is time to just not talk about your personal life. Unless you're married and have kids and grandkids or something. There is something about it to the average person that if you're not married, you're either gay, or you're a dirty old man, and I don't want to be any of those things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You've acquired dignified reticence in your old age? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, beautifully put Scott, a dignified reticence.</p>\n\n<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity and length.</em></p>\n        \n            </div>\n\n</div></body></html>", "title": "Bill Maher on Masturbation and National Security", "updated": "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 12:00:00 GMT", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/r-7tiyR6L2o/story01.htm", "_id": 336861306, "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AtlanticPoliticsChannel", "text": "Phil McCarten/ReutersAs his HBO show Real Time begins its twelfth season with higher ratings than ever\u20144.1 million viewers, high for a premium-cable talk show\u2014the iconoclastic comedian and political commentator Bill Maher spoke to The Atlantic about why he likes doing comedy shows in red states, how his show is different from Jon Stewart's, why the God of the Old Testament is \"the most psychopathic character in fiction,\" and why he believes most opposition to President Obama is racist. Let me start by asking the question you're probably most sick of answering, so we can get it out of the way. The infamous episode of your ABC show Politically Incorrect, on September 17, 2001\u2014 The tragic events of 9/17? Yes, The tragic events of 9/17. [Ed. note: Maher said, in response to President George W. Bush's comment that the 9/11 hijackers were cowards, \"We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly.\" Advertisers withdrew and the show was cancelled a few months later.] You've said the aftermath of that was the most traumatic period of your life. So I'm curious, what has it been like moving over to HBO, where there are no advertisers? And, second, why does everyone forget that when you made your remarks, you were just agreeing with a guest, Dinesh D'Souza? Yeah, I had Dinesh on our show last season, and brought that up to him. You know, I was just agreeing with what he said. I was concurring, as a good host does, you know? And maybe extrapolating a little. But yeah, I could have used a little cover from Mr. D'Souza. Are you tired of talking about the events of 9/17? No! It's now been 13 years. Do you feel like HBO has your back in a way that ABC did not? Absolutely. They always have. And, of course, let's be honest, it's easier for them to have my back because they don't have to deal with advertisers. You know, I was never mad at ABC for firing me. I totally understood that I was on a broadcast medium that depends on advertisers, and if the advertisers pull out there's really not much you can do. I was only pissed at them because they lied about it. They said we lost our audience and we never did! We always had good ratings, and we retained good ratings, and very high retention ratings from Nightline. It took a long time for Jimmy Kimmel to come up to the ratings that we used to get in that timeslot. So, that was the only thing that pissed me off about it. You're a comedian. But Real Time is somewhere between a pure comedy show and, say, Morning Joe. When you sit down to write your show, are you thinking that your job is to generate laughs, or are you trying to convey a perspective on the news? It's been observed that many young people now get their news from The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. Who's your intended audience, and what are you trying to communicate to them? Part of it is what you just attributed to those other two shows. You said people get their news from those two shows, but I'm guessing at least as many people watch my show. So, I think I'm trying to do the same thing. Give people news. The main thing I'm thinking of, because we are after all a weekly wrap-up show, is I'm doing this show for people who are interested in the news, but don't have time to follow it like I do. They have lives. They have kids. They have jobs. They can't read the paper every day. So, Friday night at 10 o'clock when they sit down in front of the television set, I want them to be able to feel as they watch it\u2014an hour of Real Time\u2014in one section of the show, either the monologue, in the New Rules, in the panel, in one of the one-on-one interviews\u2014I want them to feel like every important issue, or at least what I feel is important, that happened that week got in some way mentioned. And then, of course, I do want to make it as entertaining as possible. And we have enough prewritten stuff that I know there's always going to be laughs throughout the show. And the panel is lively too, but the panel, you know I have no control over what three other people say, or how amusing they're going to be. How do you view Stewart and Colbert? Do you see what you're doing as kind of comparable to what they're doing? Or are you doing something different? I'm more comparable to them than to, say, Dancing With the Stars. But I see vast differences. I don't think we're as predictable. I will disagree with my liberal audience. I will challenge them. Sometimes I'll even yell at them. I'm real about it. I treat the audience like real friends, and sometimes we argue. And sometimes they need to be educated about something. Sometimes liberals can be in a bubble too. And, you know, there's just a host of issues that I think our show and the old show has been out front on, that are more and more becoming mainstream. Things like atheism and marijuana legalization\u2014but not just those\u2014that I've been talking about for years; somehow things get into the mainstream after somebody has been pounding away on it for a long time. And then they just seem normal. \"I remember talking to a lot of liberal people who were saying Obama's reelection is in the bag. And I said, you know you don't get outside of your circle of people. Out there in America, it's not in the bag!\"You famously gave a million dollars of your own money to the pro-Obama super PAC. From the perspective of where we are now, do you feel that was money well spent? If you look at what the alternative universe would be under a Mitt Romney presidency, I think it's money very well spent. There's not an issue I can think of where Mitt Romney would be better. And I can only imagine what sort of cavalcade of nutcases would have followed him into Washington. Because he basically promised his soul to those hard-right groups that control the party now. And Mitt Romney never has had much of a backbone. So I'm very happy with that, because I did some research on it and it seemed to make a difference. At least that's what the people who run the PACs\u2014like Paul Begala\u2014have told me. Until we had that little bit of publicity, the big-money people on the left were kind of sitting on their hands. I got scared at that point, because I remember talking to a lot of liberal people who were saying Obama's reelection is in the bag. And I said, you know you don't get outside of your circle of people. Out there in America, it's not in the bag! Not in the bag at all. How would you characterize yourself politically? I think everybody thinks they make sense. I don't see issues ideologically. I see what makes sense. You know, I've tried to identify this new category called \"the 9/11 liberal,\" because after 9/11 there was a category that sprung up called \"9/11 conservatives.\" These were people like Dennis Miller, who became very, very conservative. Ron Silver was another one. We were all freaked out by 9/11, as we should be. It was a horrendous attack. But I think at a certain point, the liberals turned a blind eye to the singular threat that is radical Islam. This is something I've had a lot of problems with my liberal audience over, and we talk about it quite frequently on the show. That's a good example of something where I just think it makes common sense, and if you don't understand that there are disturbing percentages, often majorities of people across the Muslim world, who believe in things that are anything but liberal. You know, rule of law isn't just different than theocracy. It's better. Free speech, respect for minorities, and equality of women. Separation of church and state, freedom to practice any religion you want, or none, without the threat of violence. All of these issues, if anyone in their own country stood up against, the liberals would be incensed about. But somehow because they see Muslims as a minority, they want to defend them for the very things that are illiberal. I hold a number of positions that I think would be seen as conservative\u2014but, again, I don't see them as liberal or conservative. I see them as \"that's what I think makes sense.\" Speaking of Dennis Miller, what happened to him? Did 9/11 break him? First of all, I've never been a close friend of Dennis's. We've been colleagues for many years. Dennis is a very private guy, but we certainly were friendly. We shared the same manager for 30 years. And I'm a fan of Dennis as a comedian. I think he's a terrific kind of comedian. He really knows how to practice the art of standup comedy. That being said, yeah, he became a lot more conservative. I understood the national-security side of it. That's the \"9/11 conservative\" moniker that was hung on him and some other people, and that makes sense. What I didn't understand was why he became a down-the-line right-wing conservative on a number of issues. He's Fox News's go-to guy now. Maybe it's just the money, you know. People want to work, and he found an audience. But it doesn't really follow that you have to be conservative on every issue just because of 9/11. I cannot tell you what goes on in Dennis Miller's mind, and people ask me that all the time. It seems to be what happened to David Mamet too. That I think is religion. David Mamet is seriously influenced by religion. Very orthodox religion. And religion warps thinking. It's impossible to worship superstition on Sunday or Saturday and just be a normal person every other day of the week. Another area where you've sort of broken faith with the liberal conventional thinking is on the right of the NSA to be collecting all this metadata in the service of protecting us from what could be a really horrible nuclear catastrophe. Do you want to talk a little bit about that? Franklin didn't live in the 21st century. The worst that could've happened in his era is that the gunpowder blew up, or the musket went off. We live in a very different era.I never said that I was outright in support of the NSA. I'm certainly on the page of most Americans in that we need to know more. I think Edward Snowden did the country a great service by opening up this can of worms. What I did say in one of our editorials that we did this year is I used the quote that so often is bandied about in the media by Benjamin Franklin who said that those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither. Well, Franklin didn't live in the 21st century. Franklin didn't live in post-nuclear-weapons times. The worst that could've happened in his era is that the gunpowder blew up, or the musket went off. We live in a very different era, and I live very close to the port of Long Beach, and the port of Los Angeles, where almost half of the cargo comes in. It'd be a very likely place for them to sneak in a dirty bomb. My day would be much more ruined a dirty bomb going off than it would by the NSA knowing when I masturbate. Now I don't think the NSA should know when I masturbate, but I'm just saying, we live in different times than when Benjamin Franklin said that, so let's get real. What I did say is, I am willing to give up some liberty for some security. If the NSA's knowing when you masturbate was directly correlated with their ability to stop an attack, that would probably be okay, right? [Laughs] That would be okay, yes. I was looking at your standup schedule for the next couple of months: Mobile, Alabama; Corpus Christi, Texas; Jacksonville, Florida; Birmingham, Alabama. Do you have a death wish? Or are you trying to find the liberals there or are you trying to speak to the red staters? What's your goal in picking those venues as opposed to on the East or West Coast where it would be easy to sell out theaters? Yeah, but I can sell them out in Corpus Christi and Mobile too. The thing is, I don't have to seek out the liberals in those cities. When I come to town, they seek me out. I guess we're seeking each other out. I've learned this over the last 10 or 15 years. There are so many liberal people in conservative areas. There's a lot of reasons why people live where they live, and it's not often, or certainly not always, because that's where they're politically aligned. So there's lots of progressive, free-thinking, liberal people in all these states, and what makes it so fun to go to red areas, if you will, is that those people there are so, I think, gratified that I didn't write off the whole state, go \"Alabama, I would never go there!\" No, I understand that there are smart people living in Alabama. Yes, they're surrounded by a bunch of rednecks, but when I come to town, there's something more magical than when I go to San Francisco or New York, which is predictably liberal. And do you find that the people who turn out are, as it were, the liberal base? Or do you get more hecklers? Oh, no \u2026 I mean, I do see sometimes there's very often somebody in the front row scowling at me with his arms folded, but that's invariably a husband who was dragged there by his wife. I've seen you talk about how 25 years ago, there were Republicans you respected\u2014like Bob Dole, Howard Baker. Who in the Republican Party now, if anybody, do you respect? Oh, that's a great question. [Laughs] I don't know, do you have a few minutes while I think that over? I mean, name some people, and I'll try to\u2026 Joe Scarborough? Um, yeah, Joe is more of an honest broker. Joe will attack his own party, which I think is the key. You have to be willing to, just like when you're an artist, edit your own best jokes, or you make an album and you cut 16 tracks and you gotta take away four. You gotta be able to kill your own children. That's the same thing with politics. You have to be able to be ruthlessly self-critical and turn on your own people. I've seen Joe do that, so yeah, whenever somebody does that, I do respect them. What I do not like is people who just know how to cheer for their own team. That's the problem I have, again, sometimes with my studio audience in L.A. They only know to cheer for the blue team and boo for the red team. And it's not as simple as that. How about John McCain, who's intermittently maverick? Right. John McCain, it's almost like alternate side of the street parking. One day, he kind of takes hits and reminds you of the old maverick John McCain from 2000, the guy we all liked so much. And then he's also capable of just being as bad as anybody in the Senate.

How do you balance your excitement about that as a comedian versus your enthusiasm for\u2014or terror about\u2014the politics of it? I am not afraid of Hillary as president. She is really smart and very capable obviously. Unfortunately the Clintons are centrist Democrats, they are corporate, centrist Democrats. They are in a lot of ways part of the problem, a lot of our problems that we face now are because in the \u201890s the Democrat Party gave up on being the liberal party. And a lot of that was Bill Clinton. Glass-Steagall was repealed under Clinton. [Robert] Rubin was the treasury secretary and you were left with a country that did not have a left party. And we still don't. We have a far-right party, and we basically have a center-right party. And we don't have a left-wing party. That is why things like Obamacare are really Republican plans that were repackaged\u2014and as soon as Obama put his name on it, they didn't like it, but it is really Bob Dole's old plan. Or cap and trade! Cap and trade is somehow the Democratic response to global warming now, whereas 20 years ago, that was George [H.W.] Bush's plan to fight acid rain. So you know I am not thrilled with a Clinton presidency, but as a comedian, yes, Hillary and Bill Clinton are always going to be good for comedy. Who would thrill you politically in 2016 from either party? Elizabeth Warren would be somebody I would be very excited about. A true Democrat, a true progressive, and somebody who I think has the right ideas about everything. I love her. Obviously everybody knows your staunchly atheist views. But do you ever think about Pascal's wager, which is that, as crazy as a lot of religious doctrine may seem, and as bad as it can make people behave, what if you're wrong and you're dooming yourself to eternity in hell? Do you worry about that? Of all the reasons to be religious, that is the one of the dumber ones. What if I'm wrong? If it is the God of the Old Testament, I am so fucked already, and you and everybody else. A more psychopathic character you will not ever find in fiction. Just the idea that people worshipped the God of this Bible is insane. There is no more psychopathic mass murderer than God, so good luck with worrying that you picked the wrong religion, you're going to suffer for it. As far as the question of how do we know? No, we don't know. Am I a billion percent sure? Nobody is a billion percent sure of anything. I don't know how it all began, no one does. But I am pretty sure it's not that God had a son. [laughs] You know he's this orb of perfect energy, this powerful beyond imagination, but he's got kids. That would drive him fucking nuts, let me tell you. So you know we don't know the answers but the answer to that is not to make up stories. If you don't know something, just say, I don't know. That's your gospel right there. The gospel of \"I don't know.\" I combined apathy and atheist, and I came up with apatheist. I don't know what happens when I die, and I don't care. Is your primary goal to get people to laugh or to get them to think? I have never been interested\u2014even when I was a young comic starting out\u2014in material that didn't have some bite to it. That didn't have some nutrition to it. I never did the \"men do this, and women do this, and dogs and cats.\" Jerry Seinfeld is a genius because he can talk about trivial subjects in a way that everyone will know what he's talking about and the most intelligent people are not insulted at all and are in fact delighted. But I am not that guy. I always wanted to talk about stuff that mattered. So if my joke doesn't have some meaning behind it, I am not going to be doing that, I am not going to be interested in that subject anyway. You're a George Carlin admirer. Yeah, Carlin was pretty much the same way. But Carlin would do 20 brilliant minutes on society and then 10 minutes on farting. He mixed it up. I don't. I just do the society. What's the significance of being over 50? I just think when you're under 50, and of course you're stretching it a little into your 40s, it's okay to sort of play that, hey, I'm the swinging-bachelor type. And we did used to do jokes on Politically Incorrect, and maybe on the early years of Real Time, that ended with me in the hot tub with twins or something. There were some of those punch lines. I just think when you're over 50, I can't explain it, maybe it's not logical, but I just think it is time to just not talk about your personal life. Unless you're married and have kids and grandkids or something. There is something about it to the average person that if you're not married, you're either gay, or you're a dirty old man, and I don't want to be any of those things. You've acquired dignified reticence in your old age? Yes, beautifully put Scott, a dignified reticence.

Perhaps the most noticeable thing about the presidential love scoop is the near absence of a reaction. The main French television stations are treating the story with coy disinterest. For most of them it is way down the running order: a bit of muck dug up by their (distant) cousins in the \"people\" press. Mid-morning, no-one had even sent a crew to film the alleged trysting-place. When I arrived, I was expecting hordes. But only I and a Belgian snapper were present. Even on the French version of Google News, you have to look hard to find the latest on the Hollande-Gayet match. Either there is genuinely no interest in the story; or there is a vast conspiracy to pretend no-one's interested. From an Anglo-Saxon perspective, of course it looks faintly ludicrous - as if the French can't spot a good tale when it's staring them in the face; or else are too scared to tell it. But from a French point of view it is different. So much of the French way of doing things is conditioned by their horror at what they see when they look across the Channel. This nostrum certainly applies in the world of the press. Mr Hollande - pictured here with partner Valerie Trierweiler - will now find it difficult to relaunch his presidency, as he had been planning to do this month 'People' watching The French are brought up to believe in the appalling intrusiveness of the British and American tabloids. They also like to nurse the notion that - being open-minded types - they don't give a hoot about politicians' private lives. All of which explains why - if you ask them - most French people will agree that the Hollande love match is a non-story which their newspapers are quite right to treat with disdain. And yet. The very fact that Closer magazine has dared to go public with the story shows how things are moving. President Francois Mitterrand's wife Danielle met her husband's secret daughter after his death Such a report would have been unthinkable in the press a few years ago. True, the story of Francois Mitterrand's love-child with Anne Pingeot was first reported in Paris-Match. But that was almost certainly by prior arrangement with the people concerned. The fact is that the limits of what constitutes privacy in France are being tested as never before. Technology is changing, the press is changing, and people's expectations are changing too. Certainly French courts continue routinely to hand out damages to aggrieved celebrities. But now judges are beginning to ask difficult questions about how far the celebrities have gone to entice media interest. By posing for money in the glossies, for example. And they adjust the damages accordingly. And on the whole issue of public interest, a broader, more \"Anglo-Saxon\" reading is starting to make headway. Only a few weeks ago, for example, publishers were given the go-ahead for a book disclosing the homosexuality of a leading member of the National Front. The judges said this was acceptable because it had a bearing in the debate on gay marriage. Those in the know In the Hollande-Gayet affair, there is at the very least a case to be made that disclosure is in the public interest. Closer made a half-hearted nod in this direction by claiming there were security issues at stake. However given that the alleged love-apartment is in a guarded street next to the Elysee, that seems a little far-fetched. Closer also printed topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge in 2012 A more convincing case might be that Francois Hollande is the president of the French, and as such represents the French. So they have a right to know it, if he's planning to ditch his current \"First Mistress\" (Valerie Trierweiler) for another. Or the French might like to know what lies behind the president's widely reported unhappiness at the moment. Is his unpopularity due to the dire state of the economy? Or is it his domestic situation? But surely one of the strongest arguments in favour of disclosure is that, in fact, a lot of people had already heard rumours of the presidential affair. It was just that, as usual, these people were the Paris \"in-crowd\" - the sort of people who gravitate around the same politico-journo-thespian circles that Hollande and Gayet both frequent. Events of recent weeks - the rise of the new populism as represented by the comic Dieudonne - should have convinced anyone that one of the biggest problems in France is the growing divide between those inside the \"system\" and those out of it. The long-standing complicity of insiders in keeping certain facts to themselves has certainly not helped.", "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 16:27:20 GMT", "tags": null}, {"author": null, "html": "<html><body><div><p>Mawuvio's (God's Children) Outreach Programme in Ghana provides educational and developmental services to street children who can't afford the fees to attend government schools.</p>\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"sBody p402_premium\">\n\t\t<p>When asked for a favorite inspirational saying, Renee Farwell cites author/artist and fellow Iowan Brian Andreas: \u201cThere are things you do because they feel right and they may make no sense and they may make no money and it may be the real reason we are here: to love each other\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"hide\" href=\"#nextParagraph\">Skip to next paragraph</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"podStoryRel p402_hide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Recent posts</h3>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t<div class=\"podBrdr\">\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t&#13;\n<p id=\"ad_unit\" class=\"ad_box1\"/>\t&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<div id=\"leftcol_subscribe\">&#13;\n<p class=\"subscribe-ad_title\">Subscribe Today to the Monitor</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"subscribe-ad_message\"><a class=\"click\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=CSZ&amp;cds_page_id=137455&amp;cds_response_key=I3FZSPTL1\">Click Here</a> for your <a href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=CSZ&amp;cds_page_id=137455&amp;cds_response_key=I3FZSPTL1\">FREE 30 DAYS</a> of<br/>The Christian Science Monitor<br/>Weekly Digital Edition</p>&#13;\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<a name=\"nextParagraph\"/>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>A statement like that, for many, evokes a warm smile and a nod.

Kristjan Loftsson in the belly of one of his company's whaling ships. (Stoyan Nenov/Reuters)Iceland doesn't treat cetaceans the way most of the world wants them to be treated. Like Japan and Norway, Iceland has continued to hunt fin and minke whales in defiance of an international moratorium on the practice. It's not a challenge to find a restaurant serving whale meat in the capital city of Reykjav\u00edk. With all this in mind, is it really surprising that Iceland's whaling business has recently teamed up with a brewery to produce \"whale beer\"? Ste\u00f0ja BreweryHvalur, the company managed by \"the Icelandic Ahab\" Kristj\u00e1n Loftsson, is providing whale meal\u2014a byproduct of processing the animal's meat and oil\u2014to Ste\u00f0ja Brewery to create a limited edition product tied to Iceland's annual mid-winter festival Thorrablot. The beer, marketed as a drink for \"true vikings,\" will only be available from January 24 through February 22.

For many centuries, he said, they have celebrated this festival by eating \"cured food, including whale fat, and now we have the beer to drink with this food.\" Pickled whale blubber is a traditional Thorrablot menu item. Like so much else Iceland does with whales, the development is drawing impassioned ire from conservationists and anti-whaling activists. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) society's campaign managers have called the beer launch an attempt \"to diversify whale products in the face of almost nonexistent local consumer demand\" and \"about as immoral and outrageous as you can get.\" WDC has also gone after Hvalur for \"perversely\" powering its whale-hunting ships with whale oil.

As General Motors shed government ownership and Ford gambled on a redesign, Chrysler took on an Italian accent. DETROIT \u2014 Ever since Detroit filed for bankruptcy six months ago, political and business leaders here have insisted that the city\u2019s long-awaited comeback has already begun.This week is their chance to prove it, as thousands of automotive executives, suppliers and members of the news media descend on downtown for the annual North American International Auto Show.The auto show has historically been a financial boon to the city, and this year is no exception. Organizers estimate that it will contribute $365 million to the local economy in wages and other spending.Yet with the city mired in Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the event has taken on added importance. With Detroit\u2019s worldwide reputation as shaky as its finances, it desperately needs a successful show to improve its battered image.\u201cMy hope is that the show will give visitors an understanding of the real changes happening in the city, and that they\u2019re not just cosmetic,\u201d said Arthur C. Liebler, a former marketing executive with Chrysler and Ford. Media previews of the North American International Auto Show, held at Detroit\u2019s Cobo Center, begin Monday. Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times While Detroit\u2019s neighborhoods are deeply troubled by crime, abandonment and substandard city services, its downtown is benefiting from a wave of investment and corporate expansion. As recently as 2006, work crews prepped the city to host the Super Bowl by painting over graffiti and putting pictures of flower pots and curtains on the windows of empty buildings.Now dozens of structures are in various stages of rehabilitation, and companies like the mortgage firm Quicken Loans have filled up much of the vacant office space. Streets that were once desolate are slowly coming to life as young professionals move into restored lofts and apartments. City leaders are quick to point out other early signs of a broader revival, such as a nascent technology sector, new restaurants and retail stores, and the revamped Cobo Center convention facility, where the auto show\u2019s media previews begin Monday. Detroit still faces huge challenges as it grapples with an estimated $18 billion in debt in United States Bankruptcy Court and tries to upgrade basic services like police protection, street lighting and garbage removal. But the glamour and glitz of the auto show are a welcome relief from negative news, and an opportunity for Detroit to put on its best face for industry executives and other attendees from around the world. The Russell Industrial Center is a former auto plant, now artists\u2019 studios, that will host a G.M. event as a sign of the city\u2019s rebirth. Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times \u201cIt is very important for the auto show to go off without a hitch,\u201d said Jeffrey Stoltman, a business professor at Wayne State University, in Detroit. \u201cThis is a compelling story that the whole world is following.\u201dThis year\u2019s show has attracted 17 major auto companies, headlined by the hometown carmakers General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. More than 50 new vehicles will be unveiled at news conferences this week before the show opens to the public on Saturday.For the manufacturers, the Detroit show is a bellwether of an industry that has come back strong after bottoming out during the recession. Automakers sold 15.6 million vehicles in the United States last year, a 7.6 percent increase from the previous year and the industry\u2019s best overall performance since 2007. Detroit\u2019s mayor, Michael Duggan, visited the Cobo Center on Thursday. Carlos Osorio/Associated Press The big sales have translated into healthy profits for G.M., Ford and Chrysler. In G.M.\u2019s case, this year\u2019s auto show is an exclamation point on its unlikely turnaround from the dark days of 2009, when the company went bankrupt and needed a $49.5 billion government bailout to survive.And as the only car company with headquarters in the city, G.M. is emphasizing its Detroit roots during the auto show. The company chose to reveal a new version of its GMC Canyon pickup on Sunday night at the Russell Industrial Center, a hulking former auto plant north of downtown that has been converted into studio space for artists.\u201cIt is rustic, but it\u2019s symbolic of the revitalization of Detroit,\u201d said David Barnas, a G.M. spokesman. \u201cIt is important for us to have showcase events in locations like this.\u201d The Toyota sector at the Cobo Center was under wraps. Carlos Osorio/Associated Press The excitement surrounding the show has, however, been tempered by the harsh reality of Detroit\u2019s financial collapse.After the city filed for Chapter 9 in July, some auto executives in Europe raised concerns to the show\u2019s organizers, the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, about public safety in the city.\u201cThere were a few comments about whether we\u2019d even be having the show this year,\u201d said Joe Rohatynski, a spokesman for the dealer group. \u201cWe had to come up with a statement that this show is not going anywhere.\u201d A workers preparing a display for the 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 at the Cobo Center in Detroit. John F. Martin for Chevrolet Detroit\u2019s municipal problems have hurt the show in the past. In 1999, city snowplows struggled to clear streets leading to Cobo Center after a blizzard dumped a foot of snow on the region. And five years ago, the future of the show\u2019s downtown location was in jeopardy when Cobo\u2019s roof leaked during a custom-car exhibition.After that low point, the city transferred ownership of Cobo to a new regional convention authority.

The first\nraft of ivory tusks and trinkets will be destroyed within the next six months\nand the remaining stockpile will be burned over the next two years.</p><p>Kam-shing said that Hong Kong\nencourages \u201ccountries all over the world to make concerted efforts in combating\nillegal poaching.\u201d</p><p>According to Kam-shing, Hong Kong\nwould also destroy any future seizures of ivory and the government would\nactively promote conservation of endangered species in the country. </p><p>Hong Kong\u2019s ivory stockpile is one\nof the largest in the world. The country sees major demand for ivory from\ntourists from mainland China who buy ivory trinkets, chopsticks and carvings to\ndisplay as art. </p><p>USA and Philippines destroyed their\nstockpiles of ivory in 2013, but Hong Kong\u2019s decision is momentous because it\nrepresents a firm commitment from a nation where demand for ivory is at its\nhighest. </p><p>The government will retain a few\ntonnes of ivory for use in scientific and educational projects. This is permitted\nby Cites, the international body to protect endangered wildlife. </p><p>Conservationists\nhave applauded the decision as a major step in the battle against the ivory\ntrade. Andrea Crosta, Executive Director of the <a href=\"http://elephantleage.org\" target=\"_blank\">Elephant Action League</a> commented: \u201cI think it's a very important step, a much meaningful gesture than the\ncrush in mainland China [earlier this year].\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's early to say if we have a new\npartner in Hong Kong to curb the illegal ivory trade, but it's\ncertainly a concrete action to get rid of most of their stock.\u201d</p><p>Alex Hofford, programme director for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HK4elephants\" target=\"_blank\">Hong Kong for Elephants</a> also\ncommended the decision to destroy stockpiles: \"We think its great, we are really\nhappy with the government\u2019s decision. America, China, and now Hong Kong are\nsending strong signals to ivory traders. </p><p>\u201c[Buying ivory] immoral: its wrong\nand it should stop. This message will get through to consumers and it will\nscare them.

We should not be putting a value or function on their tusks and body parts after they have been killed in a cruel way.\u201dESAC agreed unanimously to destroy 28 tonnes of Hong Kong\u2019s stockpile by incineration after a four-hour meeting with government officials. The first raft of ivory tusks and trinkets will be destroyed within the next six months and the remaining stockpile will be burned over the next two years.Kam-shing said that Hong Kong encourages \u201ccountries all over the world to make concerted efforts in combating illegal poaching.\u201dAccording to Kam-shing, Hong Kong would also destroy any future seizures of ivory and the government would actively promote conservation of endangered species in the country. Hong Kong\u2019s ivory stockpile is one of the largest in the world. The country sees major demand for ivory from tourists from mainland China who buy ivory trinkets, chopsticks and carvings to display as art. USA and Philippines destroyed their stockpiles of ivory in 2013, but Hong Kong\u2019s decision is momentous because it represents a firm commitment from a nation where demand for ivory is at its highest. The government will retain a few tonnes of ivory for use in scientific and educational projects. This is permitted by Cites, the international body to protect endangered wildlife. Conservationists have applauded the decision as a major step in the battle against the ivory trade. Andrea Crosta, Executive Director of the Elephant Action League commented: \u201cI think it's a very important step, a much meaningful gesture than the crush in mainland China [earlier this year].\u201d\u201cIt's early to say if we have a new partner in Hong Kong to curb the illegal ivory trade, but it's certainly a concrete action to get rid of most of their stock.\u201dAlex Hofford, programme director for Hong Kong for Elephants also commended the decision to destroy stockpiles: \"We think its great, we are really happy with the government\u2019s decision. America, China, and now Hong Kong are sending strong signals to ivory traders. \u201c[Buying ivory] immoral: its wrong and it should stop. This message will get through to consumers and it will scare them. If demand stops, so will poaching.\"However, Hofford argued that the using ivory in schools for educational purposes was akin to using bags of cocaine to educate children about the dangers of drug use. He said: \"We think that treating ivory as art sends the wrong message to children. We don\u2019t think that dead body parts should be in classrooms. Ivory belongs on elephants and not in schools. Having ivory in glass boxes sends wrong signal.\"Shruti Suresh, wildlife campaigner with the Environmental investigation agency welcomed Hong Kong\u2019s recognition of \u201cthe management burden and the security risk\u201d posed by the stockpiling of ivory. However, she said \u201cwe would urge the government to ensure that the stockpiles are destroyed in a transparent manner and after conducting an audit and taking DNA samples of the seized ivory for investigation and enforcement purposes.\u201d The Independent\u2019s elephant appeal supports Space for Giants who work with international partners to stop the illegal trade of ivory.

But changes are up to the states and 8,000 local jurisdictions, where voting laws have been a partisan battleground since the 2000 presidential recount.After surveying local officials, the commission also warned of two potential crises: Voting machines purchased a decade ago, when federal funds were made available as a post-recount remedy, are breaking down or obsolete. And local schools, long a favored polling place and accessible to the disabled, increasingly are unavailable as more of them restrict entry in response to shootings like the massacre in Newtown, Conn. Related Coverage Mr. Obama noted in his 2012 victory speech that some voters were still in line that night, even as he spoke, and then announced the 10-member commission a year ago in his State of the Union address. He received the report, six months in the making, at the White House from the panel\u2019s co-chairmen \u2014 Robert F. Bauer, a Democrat, and Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a Republican, the top lawyers for his own and Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaigns. The panel also included executives, academics and state and local officials.\u201cUnlike a lot of countries, we\u2019ve got a pretty complex system,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Wednesday as the report was released. \u201cWe vote a lot. We have local jurisdictions that run these elections and it makes things a little bit more complicated.\u201dCalling the recommendations \u201coutstanding,\u201d he said, \u201cWe intend to publicize this and to then reach out to stakeholders all across the country to make sure that we can implement this.\u201dLong waits have frustrated and turned away voters in numerous states in recent presidential elections, especially in Democratic-leaning cities and small-town college campuses. The commission concluded that they \u201cresult from a combination of mismanagement, limited or misallocated resources, and long ballots.\u201dBesides making recommendations, the panel created online tools for local administrators to better allocate resources like machines, staff and polling volunteers, and compiled best practices for managing lines, at the website www.supportthevoter.gov. Given the partisan nature of much of the debate over voting practices, commission members said they focused on problems that they could unanimously agree on, and were fixable. The panel did not, for example, address the matter of voter identification cards, a particularly controversial issue that Republicans in some state legislatures have pressed.Among the commission\u2019s recommendations:\u25a0 All citizens should be allowed to register to vote or update their registrations online, to reduce time-consuming confusion at polling places.\u25a0 States should exchange data from their voter and motor-vehicle lists with other states to keep voters rolls current as many Americans move.\u25a0 All states should expand alternatives to Election Day voting, like in-person early voting and mail-in ballots. The panel did not recommend a time period for early voting; in some states Republicans have sought to restrict it.\u25a0 Schools should continue to be used as polling places, and local officials should make Election Day a day off for teachers and students where security is a concern.\u25a0 To address the impending shortage of usable voting machines, and hold down costs, the process of setting standards and certifying machines should be overhauled to allow local officials to adopt widely available technologies, such as iPads.Voter rights groups generally applauded the recommendations, and called on states to act. \u201cThese will be the new benchmarks against which future elections will be judged,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.", "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 18:38:13 GMT", "tags": ["Voting and Voters", "Presidential Election of 2012"]}, {"author": "By KIM SEVERSON", "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">As Conjugal Visits Fade, a Lifeline to Inmates\u2019 Spouses Is Lost</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    <div class=\"lede-container\">\n        <figure class=\"media photo lede layout-large-horizontal\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/13/us/PRISON-1/PRISON-1-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/13/us/PRISON-1/PRISON-1-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/13/us/PRISON-1/PRISON-1-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Ebony Fisher, 25, on the road to her mother&amp;rsquo;s house outside Vicksburg, Miss.

So black prisoners were allowed time on Sunday with spouses or, more often, prostitutes.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"4330\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">By the 1940s, makeshift lean-tos and shacks built by inmates for the visits gave way to formal facilities, and white inmates were more likely participants than black ones.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"477\" data-total-count=\"4807\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Announced in December, the decision to stop the hourlong conjugal visits came as a surprise to the handful of prison spouses who rely on them. Several have taken to Facebook and other online forums and written to lawmakers to try to save what they say is an essential part of their relationships. A Mississippi prisoners\u2019 advocacy group and a Memphis-based civil rights organization have planned a rally for Friday in Jackson, the state capital, to protest the policy change.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"151\" data-total-count=\"4958\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">But State Representative Richard Bennett, Republican of Long Beach, wants the practice stopped, and he said no amount of protest would change his mind.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"262\" data-total-count=\"5220\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He said he learned about conjugal visits a few years ago when an elementary school principal told him a student of hers had shown up with a photograph of a new sibling.

It did not get much attention, so he will try again when the Legislature meets this month. He said he was aware of Mr. Epps\u2019s plans, but wanted a permanent ban.

Visitors bring their own food and sometimes have a barbecue.In New York, about 8,000 family visits were arranged last year, a figure that corrections officials say has declined. Of those, 48 percent were with spouses. The rest were with family members such as children or parents.Studies cited by Yale law students in a 2012 review of family visitation programs showed that the programs could work as powerful incentives for good behavior, help reduce sexual activity among prisoners and help strengthen families.Though what qualifies prisoners for the visits varies from state to state, all must have records of good behavior and be legally married. In most, prisoners in maximum security or on death row are denied the visits. Federal prisons do not allow them.Mississippi ended its more extensive family visitations last year but left in place the hourlong visits, which since their inception a century ago have been designed more as a way to control inmates than nurture relationships.\u201cConjugal visits have been a privilege,\u201d said Tara Booth, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Corrections Department. \u201cSo in that sense, it has, as other internal opportunities, helped to maintain order.\u201dThe notion of allowing prisoners to have sex was born here shortly after Parchman Farm opened in 1903 as a series of work camps on 1,600 acres of rich Delta farmland. Inmates, most of whom were black, were used as free farm labor in an arrangement not that far removed from slavery.Set in the middle of the birthplace of the blues, Parchman Farm has been the subject of many songs written by classic bluesmen like Bukka White and others who did time here.The warden at the time believed sex could be used to compel black men to work harder in the fields, according to a history on the practice produced in the 1970s by Tyler Fletcher, who founded the department of criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi in 1973. So black prisoners were allowed time on Sunday with spouses or, more often, prostitutes.By the 1940s, makeshift lean-tos and shacks built by inmates for the visits gave way to formal facilities, and white inmates were more likely participants than black ones.Announced in December, the decision to stop the hourlong conjugal visits came as a surprise to the handful of prison spouses who rely on them. Several have taken to Facebook and other online forums and written to lawmakers to try to save what they say is an essential part of their relationships. A Mississippi prisoners\u2019 advocacy group and a Memphis-based civil rights organization have planned a rally for Friday in Jackson, the state capital, to protest the policy change.But State Representative Richard Bennett, Republican of Long Beach, wants the practice stopped, and he said no amount of protest would change his mind.He said he learned about conjugal visits a few years ago when an elementary school principal told him a student of hers had shown up with a photograph of a new sibling. The student\u2019s mother was incarcerated. The baby had been conceived during a conjugal visit.In 2012, Mr. Bennett introduced a bill to end the visits. It did not get much attention, so he will try again when the Legislature meets this month. He said he was aware of Mr. Epps\u2019s plans, but wanted a permanent ban. Officials have not offered any figures on the number of babies born or the program\u2019s cost.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the children conceived and to the taxpayers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are in prison for a reason. You are in there to pay your debt, and conjugal visits should not be part of the deal.\u201dBut Tina Perry, 49, a production manager at a small newspaper in eastern Mississippi, said the spouses of prisoners should not be forced to suffer any more than they already do. And the state, she said, should not take away something that is inexpensive and infrequent but essential.She has been visiting her husband in prison every couple of months for eight years. He is serving time for molesting his former wife\u2019s daughter, and has 19 more years to go. Ms. Perry said he was innocent. She called the surroundings, a small room with a thin mattress, \u201cnasty\u201d but said it was an hour she treasured nonetheless.\u201cIt\u2019s your husband,\u201d she said. \u201cYou take what you can get.\u201dMs. Fisher, whose husband is facing 60 years, said she was heartbroken because no more conjugal visits meant no children.\u201cLet me have that option,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like they are taking away my choice.\u201dBut officials who want the practice to be stopped say the state should not be helping to produce children who will be raised by single parents and possibly need state support.There are concerns, too, about cost and H.I.V. transmission.Women interviewed about the visits said they would be willing to pay to defray costs. And they made it clear that the visits were not about the sex. They are about privacy in a world where every letter is opened, every call monitored. Regular visits are crowded with other prisoners and their families.\u201cYou never just get husband and wife time,\u201d said Amy Parsons, an office worker in Arkansas who drives eight hours to see her husband, who was convicted of aggravated assault. His release date is 2022.\u201cIt\u2019s not romantic, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want people to realize it\u2019s about the alone time with your husband. I understand they are in there for a reason. Obviously they did something wrong. But they are human, too. So are we.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2014, on page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: As Conjugal Visits Fade, a Lifeline to Inmates\u2019 Spouses Is Lost.

It is an industry that famously venerates youth and, infamously, has casually destroyed so many young people, used them up then discarded them, that to list them all would fill this entire article. The film business loves to look at young people, but has less than zero interest in looking after them. Some are destroyed over a long period, such as Judy Garland, some barely have time to draw breath, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/river-phoenix\" title=\"\">River Phoenix</a>. And then are the other less sensational but no less instructive stories of the young people whose hopes were raised by the industry, but find themselves whimsically discarded.</p><p>At the start of this century, Thora Birch was one of Hollywood's most credible young actors. She transitioned nicely from cute kid actor (as Harrison Ford's daughter in 1994's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109444/reference\" title=\"\">Clear and Present Danger</a>) to interesting child star\u00a0(in 1999's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81856/american.beauty\" title=\"\">American Beauty</a>) to delightful indie darling (2001's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89474/ghost.world\" title=\"\">Ghost World</a>). Then she disappeared, and no one seemed to know where or why.</p><p>Last week, I found her in the incongruous setting of a grimly formal restaurant in west Hollywood, where tablefuls of seventysomethings ordered fillet steak while, outside, LA\u00a0was baking hot. Waiting for me in\u00a0the entrance, Birch looked utterly unchanged, in layers of dark clothes, with mussed hair and smears of blue eyeshadow across her lids.</p><p>\"It's been a while since I talked to anyone as cool as the<em> Guardian</em>,\" she says as we sit down, with an emphasis that shifts uncertainly between irony and self-deprecation. This statement seems ridiculous (on multiple levels). In 2001, Birch was nominated for a best actress Golden Globe. We happen to meet two days after this year's Golden Globes and she is, she mutters at one point, \"currently looking for an agent\". How this happened is not straightforward and it is not really clear if Birch understands it herself, or how she feels about it. Contradictions pepper her conversation. Initially, she talks about how she \"decided to take a break and live my life, branch out a little, educate myself\". But when I make the mistake of suggesting she \"stepped back\", she snaps: \"It makes me angry when you use that phrase because I didn't step back. I was always working, it's just that no one was paying attention.\" At times, she has the dazed but anxious air of someone who has just emerged from a long sleep and is astonished at how much time has passed.</p>    <span class=\"inline wide\">\n                <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390492703095/Thora-Birch-and-Scarlett--008.jpg\" alt=\"Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson\" data-pin-description=\"Thora Birch (right) with Scarlett Johansson in the 2001 film Ghost World.\"/>\n                \t\t\t<span class=\"caption\">\n\t\t\t\tThora Birch (right) with Scarlett Johansson in the 2001 film Ghost World.\n\t\t\t</span>\n            </span>\n<p>In her heyday, Birch was a lovely, natural presence on screen, the foil to her glamour-puss contemporaries, such as Mena Suvari (who also, less surprisingly, faded away) and Scarlett Johansson (who did not). She often seemed pleasingly detached from the Hollywood fluff machine, making a begrudging smile on the red carpet.</p><p>\"I tried to walk a fine line between being alluring and somewhat glamorous but maintain a strong identity and pursue things that were a little more thoughtful, and I guess nobody really wanted women to do that at that time,\" she says.</p><p>Did she feel people were trying to make her into something she wasn't? \"I\u00a0just felt like I was making people angry, because I wouldn't wear the frilly bows. I just didn't take advice and I think people got pissed off at me for not taking advice.\"</p><p>Did she struggle with the glamour that her industry demanded of her as she transitioned from being a child star? She pauses for a full minute. \"I struggled with reconciling that there was a reason for all that. I found it distasteful. So yeah, I had that kind of 'oh, piss off, everyone' attitude.\"</p><p>In the late 90s and 2000 the cool young female actors on screen were pretty, but in a grungy, even self-effacing way, and they looked as if they would rather eat their ankle-length skirts than have a blow dry: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/15/juliette-lewis-august-osage-county\" title=\"\">Juliette Lewis</a>, Julia Stiles, Leelee Sobieski, Winona Ryder. As Birch grew from child to adult actor, she fitted into this trend perfectly. But by the early noughties, a very different look was emerging for young female celebrities, one based more on Paris Hilton than Kurt Cobain. You only have to look at Ghost World to see what options were available to young women in Hollywood at the time: they could glam up and be A-list sex symbols, like Johansson, or they could refuse to wear the frilly bows and disappear, like Birch.</p><p>How does it feel when she\u00a0looks at Johansson's career, considering she accepted all the things Birch rejected?</p><p>Birch screws up her face: \"I don't know. Look at her. Whatever,\" she says in a \"like duh\" tone. \"I still love her, we were kids together \u2026\"</p><p>Another factor in Birch's disillusion with Hollywood was that she was a witness to its casualties, having worked with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/brittany-murphy\" title=\"\">Brittany Murphy </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/18/usa.film\" title=\"\">Brad Renfro</a>.</p><p>\"I'd seen Brittany here and there before and thought she was cute and lovely and all that stuff. But when I worked with her I saw the condition\" \u2013 she twirls her finger next to her head \u2013 \"and I thought, that can't be good.\"</p><p>As for poor Renfro, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/18/usa.film\" title=\"\">who died at 25 from a heroin overdose in 2008</a>, Birch says she was \"shattered by the state of him\" when they made Ghost World: \"I\u00a0wish I'd said something, like: isn't there something that should be done, other than a guardian who is not a guardian \u2026\" In neither case, she says, was she surprised when she heard about Murphy and Renfro's deaths \"and that was another problem for me\".</p>    <span class=\"inline wide\">\n                <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390492872518/Thora-Birch-and-Wes-Bentl-008.jpg\" alt=\"Thora Birch and Wes Bentley\" data-pin-description=\"Thora Birch with Wes Bentley in the 1999 film American Beauty.

It is an industry that famously venerates youth and, infamously, has casually destroyed so many young people, used them up then discarded them, that to list them all would fill this entire article. The film business loves to look at young people, but has less than zero interest in looking after them. Some are destroyed over a long period, such as Judy Garland, some barely have time to draw breath, such as River Phoenix. And then are the other less sensational but no less instructive stories of the young people whose hopes were raised by the industry, but find themselves whimsically discarded.At the start of this century, Thora Birch was one of Hollywood's most credible young actors. She transitioned nicely from cute kid actor (as Harrison Ford's daughter in 1994's Clear and Present Danger) to interesting child star (in 1999's American Beauty) to delightful indie darling (2001's Ghost World). Then she disappeared, and no one seemed to know where or why.Last week, I found her in the incongruous setting of a grimly formal restaurant in west Hollywood, where tablefuls of seventysomethings ordered fillet steak while, outside, LA was baking hot. Waiting for me in the entrance, Birch looked utterly unchanged, in layers of dark clothes, with mussed hair and smears of blue eyeshadow across her lids.\"It's been a while since I talked to anyone as cool as the Guardian,\" she says as we sit down, with an emphasis that shifts uncertainly between irony and self-deprecation. This statement seems ridiculous (on multiple levels). In 2001, Birch was nominated for a best actress Golden Globe. We happen to meet two days after this year's Golden Globes and she is, she mutters at one point, \"currently looking for an agent\". How this happened is not straightforward and it is not really clear if Birch understands it herself, or how she feels about it. Contradictions pepper her conversation. Initially, she talks about how she \"decided to take a break and live my life, branch out a little, educate myself\". But when I make the mistake of suggesting she \"stepped back\", she snaps: \"It makes me angry when you use that phrase because I didn't step back. I was always working, it's just that no one was paying attention.\" At times, she has the dazed but anxious air of someone who has just emerged from a long sleep and is astonished at how much time has passed. Thora Birch (right) with Scarlett Johansson in the 2001 film Ghost World. In her heyday, Birch was a lovely, natural presence on screen, the foil to her glamour-puss contemporaries, such as Mena Suvari (who also, less surprisingly, faded away) and Scarlett Johansson (who did not). She often seemed pleasingly detached from the Hollywood fluff machine, making a begrudging smile on the red carpet.\"I tried to walk a fine line between being alluring and somewhat glamorous but maintain a strong identity and pursue things that were a little more thoughtful, and I guess nobody really wanted women to do that at that time,\" she says.Did she feel people were trying to make her into something she wasn't? \"I just felt like I was making people angry, because I wouldn't wear the frilly bows. I just didn't take advice and I think people got pissed off at me for not taking advice.\"Did she struggle with the glamour that her industry demanded of her as she transitioned from being a child star? She pauses for a full minute. \"I struggled with reconciling that there was a reason for all that. I found it distasteful. So yeah, I had that kind of 'oh, piss off, everyone' attitude.\"In the late 90s and 2000 the cool young female actors on screen were pretty, but in a grungy, even self-effacing way, and they looked as if they would rather eat their ankle-length skirts than have a blow dry: Juliette Lewis, Julia Stiles, Leelee Sobieski, Winona Ryder. As Birch grew from child to adult actor, she fitted into this trend perfectly. But by the early noughties, a very different look was emerging for young female celebrities, one based more on Paris Hilton than Kurt Cobain. You only have to look at Ghost World to see what options were available to young women in Hollywood at the time: they could glam up and be A-list sex symbols, like Johansson, or they could refuse to wear the frilly bows and disappear, like Birch.How does it feel when she looks at Johansson's career, considering she accepted all the things Birch rejected?Birch screws up her face: \"I don't know. Look at her. Whatever,\" she says in a \"like duh\" tone. \"I still love her, we were kids together \u2026\"Another factor in Birch's disillusion with Hollywood was that she was a witness to its casualties, having worked with Brittany Murphy and Brad Renfro.\"I'd seen Brittany here and there before and thought she was cute and lovely and all that stuff. But when I worked with her I saw the condition\" \u2013 she twirls her finger next to her head \u2013 \"and I thought, that can't be good.\"As for poor Renfro, who died at 25 from a heroin overdose in 2008, Birch says she was \"shattered by the state of him\" when they made Ghost World: \"I wish I'd said something, like: isn't there something that should be done, other than a guardian who is not a guardian \u2026\" In neither case, she says, was she surprised when she heard about Murphy and Renfro's deaths \"and that was another problem for me\". Thora Birch with Wes Bentley in the 1999 film American Beauty. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/Cinetext Collection Birch was born and brought up in Los Angeles, just a few blocks from where we meet. She started acting in adverts when she was four, and loved it, despite her parents' wariness. They themselves had worked in porn films, including Deep Throat, but a question about whether their experience in the film industry made them anxious for her causes Birch's internal shutters to slam protectively down: \"I don't know. I refuse to talk to them about any of that.\"They named their daughter after Thor the Norse god (and their son Bolt, presumably after lightning), and it is a good name for her: Birch is not afraid of roaring. She has, she agrees, always been \"mouthy\", by which she means she is engaged and vocal. When she talks about the way legislation works in America, she nearly cries with frustration, and her blog is full of passionate outrage over current events. But this sense of engagement has not always made her easy to work with: when she was just 14, she was fired from the Alexander Payne film Election because \"I read the script one way and it became clear that [Payne] had seen something else, so that was it. I just thought, this is ridiculous: why is it written this way?\"In 2010, she was fired from the off-Broadway theatrical revival of Dracula after it was alleged that Birch's father, Jack, her manager and a frequent presence at his daughter's rehearsals, had physically threatened one of the other actors. Birch said at the time that she was \"in a state of shock\". When I ask Birch about it now, she looks down in silence. Then she says: \"I pissed a lot of people off over a long period of time and they found a way to upset me, hoping that upset would bring a change in my behaviour. Like a distancing \u2026 But I'm done, I'm done. People wanted me to be not fine. A lot of it was bullshit.\"Has she felt that for a long time that people are trying to get her, that they're angry with her?\"Yeah, definitely.\"Why are they angry?\"Because I should just shut up.\"Because she's a young woman? Because she's an actor?\"All of it.\"Talking with Birch is a little like trying to stand one's ground during a minor earth tremor: just when I think I've found my footing, her rhythm changes as she switches between bolshy self-confidence and nervy insecurity.
