    """
    A generic clustering function.

    It relies on the :class:`Clusterable` object's similarity function to assign
    the object to a cluster, if a qualifying one is found.

    .. note::
        This function *does not* create a new cluster if a qualifying one isn't found.

        Nor does it save the cluster changes â€“ it is expected that the database session is committed outside of the function.

    Args:
        | obj (Clusterable)     -- the object to be clustered
        | cluster (list)        -- the list of Clusters to compare to
        | threshold (float)     -- the minimum similarity threshold for a qualifying cluster
        | logger (logger)       -- will log to this logger if one is provided (default: None)

    Returns:
        | the qualifying cluster if found, else None.

    It's meant to be called from :class:`Cluster` subclass's own `cluster` methods.
