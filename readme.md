Shallow Thought
===============

To install the dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the tests:
```bash
$ nosetests
```

To setup and run MongoDB ([download](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)):
```bash
$ cd /path/to/mongodb/download
$ ./bin/mongod
```
That will run MongoDB locally at port `27107`.

Documentation is located at `doc/_build/html/index.html`.
